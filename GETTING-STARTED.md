# Getting Started — Your First 30 Minutes

**The Executive Enablement Walkthrough**
*For CEOs, founders, and senior leaders using the GetFresh CEO Enablement Kit for AI.*

## What You're About to Install

In the next 30 minutes, you will go from "AI is a blank chatbot" to "AI is my Chief of Staff." Here's exactly what happens:

| Step | What | Time | Outcome |
|------|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Clone the kit | 2 min | Kit downloaded to your machine |
| 2 | Run the installer | 5 min | Skills, memory, and hooks wired up |
| 3 | Run the onboarding wizard | 15 min | AI learns your voice, team, and priorities |
| 4 | Your first real task | 5 min | AI delivers immediate value |

**You do NOT need to be technical.** If you can open a terminal window and paste a command, you can do this.

## Before You Start

### What You Need
- [ ] A Mac, Linux machine, or Windows PC
- [ ] One of these AI tools installed: **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, or **Gemini**
- [ ] Access to the GetFresh Ventures GitHub organization (ask your GFV contact for an invite)

### What You Should Have Ready
These aren't required, but having them handy will make the onboarding wizard dramatically more useful:
- [ ] 3–5 recent emails you've written (to train your voice model)
- [ ] Your current deal pipeline (the names of your top 5 deals or prospects)
- [ ] Your weekly calendar rhythm (what recurring meetings do you have?)

---

## Step 1: Clone the Kit (2 minutes)

Open your terminal:
- **Mac:** Open the "Terminal" app (search Spotlight for "Terminal")
- **Windows:** Open "PowerShell" (search Start for "PowerShell")

Paste this command and press Enter:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:GetFresh-Ventures/gfv_growth_by_design.git ~/.gfv_growth_by_design
```

> **What just happened?** You downloaded the entire kit to a hidden folder on your machine. Your data stays local — nothing is uploaded to the cloud.

---

## Step 2: Run the Installer (5 minutes)

Navigate to the kit and run the bootstrap script:

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
cd ~/.gfv_growth_by_design
./bootstrap.sh
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
cd ~\.gfv_growth_by_design
.\bootstrap.ps1
```

The installer will ask you one question: whether to install the EngineClaw autonomous runtime (for advanced users who want background AI workers). **If you're unsure, choose "N"** — you can always add it later.

### What the Installer Does

Behind the scenes, the installer:

1. **Creates your Dual-Brain system:**
   - `~/ceo-brain/` — Your personal identity: voice model, meeting prep, weekly notes
   - `~/gtm-brain/` — Your business state: pipeline data, campaign performance, learnings

2. **Registers 74 skills** as native `/slash` commands in Claude Code (or reads them automatically in Cursor/Gemini)

3. **Wires lifecycle hooks** so your AI automatically:
   - Loads your context at session start (no "remind me who I am" every time)
   - Saves state at session end (nothing is lost between conversations)
   - Reviews outbound messages before sending (safety gate)

4. **Installs advanced tooling** (ccflare for cost monitoring, Dippy for frictionless approvals)

> ✅ **When you see "Bootstrap Complete!"** you're ready for Step 3.

## Step 3: The Onboarding Wizard (15 minutes)

This is where the magic happens. Open your AI assistant and paste this:

```text
Initialize GFV Chief of Staff Sequence.

1. Read the `AGENT.md` file in the root to internalize the GFV operating boundaries.
2. Ensure you have access to the `/skills/` directory.
3. IMMEDIATELY execute the `/onboard` skill to launch the interactive setup wizard.
   Do not output anything else; simply launch the wizard starting with Phase 0.
```

The AI will walk you through four phases:

### Phase 0: Ecosystem Map
*"What tools does your organization use?"*

The AI asks which CRM you use (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.), your email platform, project management tool, and calendar. This maps your tech stack so the AI knows where to look for data.

### Phase 1: Delegation Map
*"Who's on your team and what do they own?"*

You'll describe your direct reports, their roles, and their ownership areas. This way, when the AI drafts an action item ("schedule the QBR"), it knows to assign it to the right person.

### Phase 2: Voice Calibration
*"Share 3–5 emails you've recently written."*

Paste a few real emails. The AI analyzes your writing patterns — sentence length, tone, vocabulary, punctuation habits — and builds a `voice-model.md` that ensures all future AI-drafted communications sound authentically like you. No more "I hope this email finds you well."

### Phase 3: Live Demonstration
*"Let me show you what I can do right now."*

The AI reads your calendar (if connected) and prepares a real meeting brief for your next meeting, demonstrating immediate ROI.

> 💡 **Tip:** Be honest and specific during onboarding. The more context you give, the more leverage you get from every future interaction.

---

## Step 4: Your First Real Task (5 minutes)

Now that you're set up, try one of these high-impact first tasks:

### Option A: Pre-Meeting Intelligence Brief
> *"I have a meeting with [Name] from [Company] tomorrow. Run meeting-prep."*

The AI will research the person, pull any CRM history, and build you a 1-page dossier with talking points and your strategic angle.

### Option B: Pipeline Sanity Check
> *"Run pipeline-pulse. Be brutally honest about what's stale."*

The AI reviews your active deals, flags anything with no activity in 14+ days, and drafts follow-up actions for each.

### Option C: Write an Email in Your Voice
> *"Draft an email to [Name] at [Company] about [topic]. Use my voice model."*

The AI writes using your actual communication style — not generic AI speak.

### Option D: Prep Your Week
> *"Run weekly-ceo-brief. What should I focus on this week?"*

The AI synthesizes your pipeline, recent meetings, and outstanding commitments into a scannable executive brief.

## Understanding Your Skill Library

You now have access to **74 pre-built skills** organized into 8 categories. You don't need to memorize them — just describe what you need and the AI will route to the right skill automatically.

### Most-Used Skills for Executives

| Meeting prep | "Prep me for my call with [Name]" | `meeting-prep` |

## Safety Guarantees

This kit is designed with executive-grade safety controls built in:

### 📧 No Autonomous Sending
The AI will **never** send an email, Slack message, or any communication without showing you the full draft and getting your explicit "send it" approval. It always drafts first.

### 🔒 Local-First Data
Your voice model, pipeline data, and meeting prep live on YOUR machine in `~/ceo-brain` and `~/gtm-brain`. They are not uploaded to any cloud service.

### ✅ Source Verification
The AI verifies claims against live data sources (CRM, calendar, etc.) before asserting facts about your pipeline. It doesn't guess — it checks.

### 🛡 Credential Security
All API keys and tokens are stored in your system's secure credential manager (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager). Nothing is hardcoded in files.

---

## Recurring Rhythms — Building the Habit

The real ROI comes from consistent weekly use. Here's the recommended cadence:

### Monday Morning (5 min)
> *"Run weekly-ceo-brief. What are my priorities this week?"*

### Before Each Meeting (2 min)
> *"Prep me for my [time] meeting with [Name]."*

### After Each Meeting (3 min)
> *"Process these notes from my call with [Company]: [paste notes]"*

### Friday Afternoon (5 min)
> *"Run pipeline-pulse. What moved this week? What's stuck?"*

### Sunday Night (Optional, 2 min)
> *"Run the dream consolidation to compress this week's learnings."*

---

## Troubleshooting

### "The AI doesn't know who I am"
Run the onboarding wizard again: say *"Run /onboard"*. Or check that `~/ceo-brain/voice-model.md` exists and has content.

### "The AI sounds generic"
Your voice model needs more samples. Paste 3–5 more emails and say: *"Update my voice model with these samples."*

### "I can't clone the repo"
You need an SSH key connected to your GitHub account AND access to the GetFresh-Ventures organization. Ask your GFV contact to add you.

### "The installer failed on Windows"
Make sure you're running PowerShell as Administrator. Use `.\bootstrap.ps1` (not `./bootstrap.sh`).

### "How do I update to the latest version?"
```bash
cd ~/.gfv_growth_by_design
git pull
./bootstrap.sh
```
The installer is idempotent — it only adds what's missing, never overwrites your data.
