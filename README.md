## Stop Adding Headcount. Start Engineering Growth.

Revenue generation is a systems engineering problem — not a hiring problem. Pipelines, conversion paths, attribution loops, campaign orchestration, lead scoring — these are interconnected subsystems with feedback mechanisms. Treating them as tasks assigned to humans creates latency. Every handoff is a delay. Every weekly sync is a batch process in a world that demands real-time.

**Growth by Design™** is the exact methodology [GetFresh Ventures](https://www.getfreshventures.com) uses to embed agentic AI into GTM systems for growth-stage CEOs — the same approach that has impacted **$500M+ in client revenue** and engineered **6 successful exits** across 50+ companies.

This kit is that methodology, open-sourced.

---

## What This Kit Does

The GxD CEO AI Kit installs directly into your local development environment — Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Gemini, or Copilot — and transforms it from a generic chatbot into an **autonomous Chief of Staff** that knows your voice, your deals, and your weekly rhythm.

| What changes | Before | After |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Email drafting** | Generic AI tone | Writes in *your* voice, trained on your actual emails |
| **Meeting prep** | Walk in cold | AI delivers intelligence dossiers before every call |
| **Pipeline management** | Weekly spreadsheet review | Continuous monitoring with stale-deal alerts |
| **Content strategy** | Ad hoc posts | System-driven content calendar with buyer-stage mapping |
| **Strategic decisions** | Gut feel | 5-perspective GO/NO-GO/DEFER framework |

**Your data stays on your machine.** No cloud uploads. No SaaS telemetry. The AI communicates only via secured API endpoints you control.

## The Growth by Design™ Architecture

This kit implements the same three-layer architecture that powers GetFresh Ventures' client engagements:

### Three Pillars (from the Growth by Design™ Methodology)

| Pillar | What It Means | Kit Implementation |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **GTM Strategy** | Pipeline intelligence, revenue systems, and sprint planning | C-Suite Advisory skills, Revenue Enablement skills |
| **AI Engineering** | Hands-on sprints that ship AI into your GTM | Developer & DevOps skills, automation hooks |
| **AI Adoption** | Personal AI operating systems configured to your voice and context | Voice model, onboarding wizard, Sherpa Protocol |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GetFresh-Ventures/gxd-ceo-ai-kit.git ~/Documents/gxd-ceo-ai-kit
cd ~/Documents/gxd-ceo-ai-kit
./bootstrap.sh          # Mac/Linux
# .\bootstrap.ps1       # Windows
```

Then open the folder in **Cursor** (or your preferred AI IDE) and type `/onboard` in the chat.

The onboarding wizard takes ~15 minutes. It will:
1. **Calibrate your voice** — Paste a few emails, and the AI learns to write like you
2. **Map your team** — Who handles what, so the AI routes correctly
3. **Load your pipeline** — Enter your top deals for continuous monitoring

> **You don't need to be technical.** If you can open a terminal and paste a command, you can do this. The kit includes a Sherpa Protocol that teaches IDE fluency to first-time users.

For the full walkthrough, see **[GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md)**.

## Full Capabilities: 194 Domain Skills

Skills are composable instruction sets that augment the baseline intelligence of an LLM. Instead of generic chat completion, the AI retrieves a proven playbook at runtime — ensuring it operates with the rigor of a seasoned operator, not an entry-level assistant.
