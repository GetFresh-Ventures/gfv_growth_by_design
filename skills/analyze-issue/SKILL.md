# Systematic Issue Analysis

Find root cause before attempting fixes. Guessing wastes time and creates new bugs.

**The Iron Law:** No fixes without root cause investigation first.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Debug this error: [paste error]"
- "Why is [feature] broken?"
- "Systematically find the root cause of [bug]"


## When to Use

- Test failures or build errors
- Unexpected runtime behavior
- Performance degradation
- "It worked yesterday" scenarios
- User-reported bugs
- After a failed fix attempt — especially then

## Phase 1: Reproduce and Observe

**Before touching any code:**

1. **Read the error completely**
   - Full stack trace, not just the last line
   - Note file paths, line numbers, error codes
   - Check if the error message contains the solution (it often does)

2. **Reproduce consistently**
   ```bash
   # Capture exact reproduction steps
   # Step 1: [exact command or action]
   # Step 2: [exact command or action]
   # Expected: [what should happen]
   # Actual: [what actually happens]
   ```
   - If not reproducible → add logging/instrumentation, don't guess

3. **Check what changed recently**
   ```bash
   # Recent commits
   git log --oneline -10

   # What changed in relevant files
   git diff HEAD~5 -- path/to/suspected/files

   # Recent dependency changes
   git diff HEAD~5 -- package.json requirements.txt Cargo.toml
   ```

## Phase 2: Trace the Data Flow

**Find WHERE it breaks, not just THAT it breaks:**

For multi-component systems (API → service → database, CI → build → deploy):

```
For EACH component boundary:
  1. Log/inspect what data ENTERS the component
  2. Log/inspect what data EXITS the component
  3. Find the layer where input is correct but output is wrong
  → THAT layer contains the bug
```

Example diagnostic instrumentation:
```bash
# Layer 1: API receives request
echo "=== Request payload: ==="
echo "$REQUEST_BODY" | jq .

# Layer 2: Service processes
echo "=== After transform: ==="
echo "$TRANSFORMED" | jq .

# Layer 3: Database query
echo "=== Query: ==="
echo "$SQL_QUERY"
echo "=== Result rows: $(echo "$RESULT" | wc -l) ==="
```

## Phase 3: Form and Test Hypothesis

**Scientific method — one variable at a time:**

1. **State the hypothesis clearly:**
   > "The bug is in [component] because [evidence]. Specifically, [X] happens when it should [Y] because [Z]."

2. **Test with the SMALLEST possible change**
   - One variable at a time
   - Never fix multiple things simultaneously
   - If hypothesis is wrong → form a NEW one, don't stack fixes

3. **Create a failing test first**
   ```
   Write a test that:
   - Passes with the bug present (reproduces the issue)
   - Will pass when the root cause is fixed
   ```

## Phase 4: Fix and Verify

1. **Fix the root cause, not the symptom**
   - If the fix is a null check → ask "why is it null in the first place?"
   - Trace upstream until you find the actual source of bad data

2. **Verify comprehensively**
   - Your failing test now passes?
   - No OTHER tests broke?
   - The original user-reported scenario works?
   - Edge cases covered?

3. **If fix doesn't work after 3 attempts → STOP**
   - 3+ failed fixes = architectural problem, not a bug
   - Question whether the pattern itself is sound
   - Escalate to the CEO/user before attempting fix #4

## Red Flags — Return to Phase 1

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, STOP:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)

## Output Format

```markdown
## Issue Analysis: [Brief Description]

**Symptom:** [What the user sees]
**Root Cause:** [What actually causes it]
**Evidence:** [How you confirmed this]

### Fix
- **File:** `path/to/file.py:42`
- **Change:** [Description of the fix]
- **Why:** [Why this fixes the root cause, not just the symptom]

### Verification
- [ ] Failing test created and passes after fix
- [ ] Existing test suite passes
- [ ] Original scenario works end-to-end
```

## Integration

- If analysis reveals a code quality issue → chain with `/review-pr`
- If fix requires planning → chain with `/create-prd`
- If issue is in production → document in `~/gtm-brain/learnings.md`
