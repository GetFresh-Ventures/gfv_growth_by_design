# Automation Recommender

Analyze a codebase, workflow, or business process and produce a prioritized, actionable automation plan. Every recommendation includes exact implementation steps — no hand-waving.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "What should I automate in my workflow?"
- "Analyze my codebase for automation opportunities"
- "Where am I wasting time that a bot could handle?"


## When to Use

- User asks "what should I automate?"
- After onboarding, to suggest next-level optimizations
- When reviewing a new project for skill/hook opportunities
- When the user feels like they're doing repetitive work
- Post-sprint, to identify patterns that should become skills

## Phase 1: Discovery & Inventory

### 1A. Codebase Scan
Run these checks to build a project fingerprint:

```bash
# Language and framework detection
ls package.json pyproject.toml Cargo.toml go.mod Gemfile pom.xml 2>/dev/null
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('deps:', list(d.get('dependencies',{}).keys())[:20])"

# Structure analysis
find . -maxdepth 3 -type d | head -30
find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*_test.*" -o -name "test_*" | wc -l

# Existing automation
ls .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null
ls .husky/ 2>/dev/null
cat Makefile 2>/dev/null | head -20
ls hooks/ 2>/dev/null
```

### 1B. Workflow Pattern Detection
Look for these automation-ready patterns:

| Signal | What it means | Automation type |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Manual `git add && git commit` | No commit workflow | Pre-commit hook |
| Repeated API calls in code | API wrapper candidate | Skill or MCP server |
| Copy-paste between files | Template candidate | Scaffolding skill |
| Manual deployment steps | CI/CD candidate | GitHub Action or skill |
| Recurring data transforms | Pipeline candidate | Cron + DAG orchestration |
| Email/Slack copy-paste | Communication template | Skill with voice model |
| Repeated prompts | Prompt template | Skill with steps |

### 1C. User Interview
Ask these 3 questions:

1. "What task do you do repeatedly that feels tedious?"
2. "What breaks most often, or what do you forget to do?"
3. "What data do you wish was automatically available when you start working?"

## Phase 2: Recommendation Engine

Score each candidate automation on a 2x2 matrix:

```

```

### Recommendation Categories

**🪝 Hooks** (lowest effort, immediate value)
- Pre-commit: lint, format, block secrets
- Pre-send: draft review gate
- Session-start: context loading
- Session-stop: memory persistence

**🎯 Skills** (medium effort, high reuse)
- Any workflow with 3+ steps that repeats weekly
- Any analysis that requires the same data sources
- Any communication that follows a template

**🔌 MCP Servers** (medium effort, deep integration)
- Match against user's stack:
  - React/Next.js → Context7 for docs
  - Supabase → Supabase MCP
  - Stripe → Stripe MCP
  - PostgreSQL → PostgreSQL MCP
  - Browser testing → Playwright MCP

**⏰ Cron/Scheduled Tasks** (higher effort, autonomous value)
- Pipeline health checks (daily)
- Stale deal alerts (weekly)
- Competitor monitoring (weekly)
- Report generation (weekly)

**🤖 Agent Pipelines** (highest effort, transformative)
- Multi-source data reconciliation (DAG mode)
- Strategic analysis with debate (Debate mode)
- Autonomous development with verification (Planner-Runner)

| # | Automation | Type | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|---|-----------|------|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | [name]    | Hook | High   | 10min  | Now      |

| 3 | [name]    | MCP  | Medium | 30min  | This week|
```

## Red Flags — When to Stop

- If the user has < 5 files in their project, they don't need automation yet
- If existing CI/CD covers most workflows, focus on AI-specific additions only
- Never recommend automating something the user does once a quarter

## Live Integration Hooks

| System | What It Provides | How to Access |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Client CRM | Real-time pipeline state | `hubspot-api` / `salesforce-api` |
| Local Memory | Client-specific facts | `gfv-brain-search.py` |

> **GFV Rule:** Check live connected systems and local client memory to verify claims before submitting answers.

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these issues WITHOUT being asked when you notice them in context:
- **Missing Data** → Flag explicitly if a decision relies on unknown external variables.
- **Scope Creep** → Alert if the requested operation spans beyond immediate context goals.
- **Executive Bottlenecks** → Warn if the action plan relies entirely on unassigned human approval gates.
- **Financial Risk** → Call out actions that may trigger unexpected OPEX burn (e.g. infinite LLM agent loops).

## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | You get... |
|---------------------|------------|
| Process Map | A mermaid.js chronological diagram |
| Executive Decision | BOTTOM LINE FIRST layout with options + trade-offs |
| Data Audit | A structured table grouping issues by severity |
| Code Execution | Isolated, copy-ready code blocks + terminal commands |

## Confidence Tagging

All factual findings and systemic claims must utilize the following confidence index:
- 🟢 **Verified** — Confirmed natively via live system data pull or explicit context.
- 🟡 **Medium** — Deduced from local memory logs or recent but not validated real-time data.
- 🔴 **Assumed** — No source available, utilizing best-judgment baseline.

## <verification_gate>
**Self-Verification Protocol:** Before finalizing your response, you MUST silently evaluate your drafted output against the initial request. Have you provided concrete Action Items with ownership? Did you use the Bottom Line First formatting? Have you applied Confidence Tags to your claims? If not, rewrite the response before submitting.

## After This Skill
💡 Suggest these next steps:
- "Want me to build the top recommendation?" → `/create-skill` or `/feature-architect`
- "Want me to set up the hooks?" → implement directly
- "Want me to schedule the cron jobs?" → `/cron-scheduler`
