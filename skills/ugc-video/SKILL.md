**Usage**: Transform a script, blog post, or talking points into a finished UGC-style video with AI-generated talking head, B-roll, voiceover, and subtitles.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Script a 60-second product demo video"
- "Create a talking-head video script for [topic]"
- "Plan a video content series"


## The UGC Content Machine

User-Generated Content style videos drive 4x higher engagement than polished brand content. This skill automates the production pipeline so the CEO can produce daily video content without a video team.

## Pipeline

### 1. Script Generation
- Accept input: raw topic, blog post URL, meeting notes, or bullet points.
- Generate a 30-60 second script optimized for the target platform.
- Structure: Hook (3s) → Problem (10s) → Solution (15s) → CTA (5s).

### 2. Visual Production
- **AI Talking Head**: Generate using HeyGen, Synthesia, or D-ID APIs.
- **B-Roll**: Source from Pexels/Pixabay APIs (royalty-free) matched to script keywords.
- **Text Overlays**: Auto-generate caption cards for key stats or quotes.
- **Subtitles**: Burn-in captions (95% of social video is watched on mute).

### 3. Platform Optimization
| Platform | Aspect Ratio | Max Duration | Format |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| TikTok | 9:16 | 60s optimal | MP4 |
| Instagram Reels | 9:16 | 90s max | MP4 |
| LinkedIn | 1:1 or 16:9 | 2 min optimal | MP4 |
| YouTube Shorts | 9:16 | 60s | MP4 |

### 4. Review & Approval
- Present video preview + script side-by-side.
- CEO approves or requests revision.
- Route approved videos to `social-scheduler` for distribution.

## Constraints
- All AI-generated faces must be clearly disclosed as AI in the video description.
- Never use real people's likenesses without consent.
- Voice cloning requires explicit CEO opt-in and disclosure.
