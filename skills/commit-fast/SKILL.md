# Commit Fast

Analyze the current git state, generate a properly structured commit message, and execute — no copy-paste required.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Commit my changes with a good message"
- "Stage and commit everything"
- "Auto-commit with semantic message"


## Execution Sequence

### 1. Assess State

```bash
# What's the situation?
git status --short

# What branch are we on?
git branch --show-current
```

**Decision tree:**
- Nothing modified → "Working tree clean. Nothing to commit."
- Untracked files only → Ask: "Stage these new files? [list them]"
- Modified + untracked → Stage tracked modifications; ask about untracked
- Everything staged → Skip to step 3

### 2. Stage Intelligently

```bash
# Stage all modified tracked files
git add -u

# If user wants everything including new files
git add -A

# For selective staging (when changes span unrelated work)
git add path/to/specific/files
```

**Split rule:** If the diff touches 3+ unrelated subsystems, suggest splitting into separate commits. Example: "This diff changes the API handler, the CSS, and the CI config. Want me to split into 3 commits?"

### 3. Generate Commit Message

Read the staged diff:
```bash
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached
```

**Conventional Commits format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body — what and why, not how]

[optional footer — breaking changes, issue refs]
```

**Type reference:**

| Type | When to use |
|------|------------|
| `feat` | New feature or capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace (no logic change) |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring (no behavior change) |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or fixing tests |
| `chore` | Build, CI, deps, tooling |
| `security` | Security fix or hardening |

**Scope detection:** Infer from file paths. If all changes are in `skills/` → scope is `skills`. If mixed → use the primary subsystem or omit scope.

**Good vs bad messages:**

| ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|--------|---------|
| "update stuff" | `feat(api): add pagination to /deals endpoint` |
| "fix bug" | `fix(auth): prevent token refresh race condition` |
| "changes" | `refactor(hooks): extract validation into shared utility` |
| "WIP" | `chore: stage progress on migration (incomplete)` |

### 4. Execute

```bash
git commit -m "<generated message>"
```

Show the user:
```
✅ Committed: <type>(<scope>): <description>
   <N> files changed, <+> insertions, <-> deletions
   Branch: <branch-name>
```

### 5. Follow-up Options

After committing, offer if relevant:
- **Push?** `git push origin <branch>`
- **Tag?** `git tag -a v<version> -m "<message>"`
- **Another commit?** (if unstaged changes remain)
- **PR?** `gh pr create --title "<message>" --body "<body>"`

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Merge conflict markers in staged files | Abort. "Resolve conflicts first." |
| `.env` or secrets in staged files | Block. "Remove sensitive files from staging." |
| Massive diff (500+ lines) | Suggest splitting. Show file groupings. |
| Amend previous commit | `git commit --amend --no-edit` (if user asks) |
| Fixup for earlier commit | `git commit --fixup=<sha>` then `git rebase -i --autosquash` |

## Integration

- Run after `/review-pr` approves changes
- Chain with `project-release` for tagged releases
- Use `verify-execution` to confirm tests pass before committing
