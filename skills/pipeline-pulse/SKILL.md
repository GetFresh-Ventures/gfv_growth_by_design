# Pipeline Pulse

Your pipeline health monitor — with teeth. Don't just report, resolve.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "What's happening in my pipeline?"
- "Give me a pipeline health check"
- "Show me deals at risk and what to do about them"

## When to Activate

- End of week pipeline review (Friday)
- Before weekly standup or team meeting
- Monthly/quarterly business reviews
- Investor update preparation
- Any time the CEO asks "what's happening in the pipeline"

## The Resolve-First Rule

**From clawchief:** Don't just summarize pipeline state — resolve what you can in the same turn.

| Signal | Bad Response | Good Response |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Deal stuck 14+ days | "Deal X is stalled" | "Deal X stalled 14 days. Follow-up drafted. Recommend sending today." |
| Prospect replied positively | "Prospect Y is interested" | "Prospect Y interested. Meeting booked for Thursday. HubSpot updated to 'Qualified'." |
| No activity on deal | "Deal Z has no activity" | "Deal Z: last touch 21 days ago. Created follow-up task GFV-XXX due tomorrow." |

## Follow-Up Cadence (Default)

For unanswered outreach:
- **First follow-up**: ~2 days after last unanswered outbound
- **Second follow-up**: ~5 days after previous follow-up
- **Third follow-up**: ~7 days after previous follow-up
- **After third**: Stop auto-sequence, escalate if deal still matters

Rules:
- Reset clock after each new outbound
- Record each follow-up in tracker notes
- Don't auto-follow-up when thread is sensitive, closed, or CEO said stop

## Data Sources

Pull from (in priority order):
1. **HubSpot** — Deal pipeline, stage, amount, activity
2. **Linear** — Related tasks and blockers
3. **Calendar** — Upcoming meetings with prospects
4. **Email** — Recent outbound and replies
5. **Previous pulse** — Week-over-week comparison

## Source-of-Truth Rule

The CRM/tracker is the live source of truth — not local files, not memory.
- Always read current state before reporting
- Update the tracker as part of the sweep, not as an afterthought
- If pipeline state changes during the sweep, update immediately in the same turn

## Quality Gate

Before delivering pipeline pulse:
- [ ] Every stalled deal has a recommended action
- [ ] Forward movement is attributed (what caused it)
- [ ] Losses have root cause analysis (not just "lost")
- [ ] Actions were taken (not just reported)
- [ ] Week-over-week comparison is included
- [ ] Next week priorities are specific, not generic
