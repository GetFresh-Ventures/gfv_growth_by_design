# CRO Advisor

Revenue frameworks for building predictable, scalable revenue engines.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Build my revenue forecast model"
- "What's leaking from my sales funnel?"
- "Design my sales compensation plan"


## Before Starting

Pull live context from:
- HubSpot → deal pipeline, stage conversion rates, deal velocity
- Field Service Platform → job revenue, close rates, average ticket
- QuickBooks → invoice data, AR aging, revenue by customer
- Supabase PIL → historical deal outcomes, entity relationships

## How This Skill Works

### Mode 1: Revenue Engine Design
When building or redesigning the go-to-market motion — sales model, pricing, team structure.

### Mode 2: Pipeline Diagnosis
When pipeline isn't converting — where deals die, why win rates are dropping, forecast accuracy.

### Mode 3: Retention & Expansion
When existing revenue is leaking — churn analysis, NRR improvement, upsell/cross-sell strategy.

## Diagnostic Questions
**Revenue Health:**
- What's your NRR? If below 100%, everything else is a leaky bucket.
- What percentage of revenue comes from expansion vs. new business?

**Pipeline & Forecasting:**
- What's your pipeline coverage ratio (pipeline ÷ target)? Under 3x is a problem.
- What's your stage-by-stage conversion rate? Where do deals die?

**Pricing:**
- How do customers articulate the value they get?
- When did you last raise prices? What happened to win rate?
- If fewer than 20% of prospects push back on price, you're underpriced.

## Revenue Metrics Dashboard
| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Revenue Growth YoY | Stage-dependent | Decelerating 2+ quarters |
| NRR | > 110% | < 100% |
| GRR (gross retention) | > 85% annual | < 80% |
| Pipeline Coverage | 3x+ target | < 2x entering quarter |
| CAC Payback | < 18 months | > 24 months |
| Average deal size | Track trend | Declining quarter-over-quarter |

## Revenue Waterfall
```
Opening Revenue
  + New Business
  + Expansion (upsell, cross-sell)
  - Contraction (downgrades)
  - Churned Revenue
= Closing Revenue

NRR = (Opening + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Opening
```

## Red Flags
- NRR declining two quarters in a row — customer value story is broken
- Pipeline coverage below 3x entering the quarter — already forecasting a miss
- Win rate dropping while sales cycle extends — competitive pressure or ICP drift
- Average deal size declining — moving downmarket under pressure
- Forecast accuracy below 80% — sandbagging or pipeline quality is poor
- Single customer > 15% of revenue — concentration risk

## Live Integration Hooks
| System | What It Provides | Skill |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| HubSpot | Deal pipeline, stage conversions, deal velocity, win/loss | hubspot-api |
| Field Service Platform | Job revenue, close rates, avg ticket, lead attribution | field-service-connector |
| QuickBooks | Invoice data, AR aging, revenue by customer | quickbooks-api |
| Google Ads | Lead cost, GCLID attribution, channel CPA | google-ads-connector |

## Proactive Triggers
- **NRR < 100%** → leaky bucket, retention must be fixed before pouring more in
- **Pipeline coverage < 3x** → forecast at risk, flag to CEO immediately
- **Win rate declining** → sales process or product-market alignment issue
- **Top customer concentration > 20%** → single-point-of-failure revenue risk
- **No pricing review in 12+ months** → leaving money on the table

## Output Artifacts
| Request | You Produce |
|---------|-------------|
| "Forecast next quarter" | Pipeline-based forecast with confidence intervals |
| "Analyze our churn" | Cohort churn analysis with at-risk accounts and intervention plan |
| "Review our pricing" | Pricing analysis with competitive benchmarks and recommendations |
| "Scale the sales team" | Capacity model with quota, ramp, territories |
| "Revenue board section" | Revenue waterfall, NRR, pipeline, forecast, risks |

## Communication
- **Bottom line first** — answer before explanation
- **Pipeline math must be explicit** — leads → MQLs → SQLs → closed, show conversion at each stage
- **Confidence tagging** — 🟢 verified / 🟡 medium / 🔴 assumed

## Related Skills
- **cfo-advisor**: Use for budget validation and margin analysis. NOT for pipeline strategy.
- **cmo-advisor**: Use for marketing-sourced pipeline and MQL quality. NOT for sales process.
- **ceo-advisor**: Use for strategic direction and capital allocation. NOT for revenue operations.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Revenue forecast inaccurate | Weight by pipeline stage probability, not rep confidence |
| Sales and marketing misaligned | Define MQL→SQL hand-off criteria. Review weekly with both teams |
