# Weekly CEO Brief

Your week distilled into what actually matters — with open items resolved, not just listed.

## When to Activate

- Friday afternoon / Sunday evening
- Before weekly leadership standup
- For investor or board reporting
- Any time the CEO asks "how was the week"

## The Resolve-First Rule

**Don't just report the week — close loops during the synthesis.**

| Bad Brief | Good Brief |
|-----------|------------|
| "Deal X had no activity" | "Deal X stalled 12 days. Follow-up drafted and task created (GFV-XXX). Recommend sending Monday." |
| "Meeting with Acme happened" | "Met Acme. They're interested. Follow-up email drafted. HubSpot updated to Qualified. Next meeting Thursday." |
| "We had 3 risks" | "3 risks identified. Risk A mitigated (changed approach). Risk B needs your decision by Tuesday. Risk C is monitoring only." |

## Data Sources

Pull from (in priority order) — **never from memory alone:**
1. **HubSpot** — deal movement, new opportunities, stage changes
2. **Linear** — tasks completed, tasks created, blockers
3. **Calendar** — meetings attended this week
4. **Email** — commitments made, follow-ups pending
5. **Previous brief** — week-over-week comparison (is pipeline growing?)
6. **PIL** — relationship context, entity history

## Output Format

```markdown
# CEO Brief — Week of [Date]

## 🎯 This Week in One Sentence
[The single most important thing]

## Pipeline
- **New opportunities**: X ($X)
- **Deals progressed**: X
- **Deals won**: X ($X)
- **Deals lost**: X ($X)
- **Net change**: +/- $X vs last week
- **Total active pipeline**: $X (↑/↓ from $X)

## Key Meetings (What Mattered)
| Meeting | With | Outcome | Next Step | System Updated? |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| [meeting] | [who] | [what happened] | [specific next] | ✅ Linear/HubSpot |

## Commitments Tracker
### We Owe
| What | To Whom | By When | Status | Action Taken |
|------|---------|---------|--------|--------------|

### They Owe Us
| What | From Whom | Expected | Status | Follow-up Created? |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|-------------------|

## Wins 🎉
- [Concrete win with numbers and attribution]

## Risks ⚠️
| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| [risk] | 🔴/🟡 | [specific action] | [who] | [done/pending/needs decision] |

## Open Loops Resolved This Synthesis
- [x] Created follow-up task for Deal X (GFV-XXX)
- [x] Drafted follow-up email for Acme meeting
- [ ] Needs the CEO: Decision on Risk B by Tuesday

## Next Week Priorities
1. [Most important — tied to revenue]
2. [Second — what moves the needle]
3. [Third — what prevents regression]
```

## Rules

1. **Lead with "so what"** — not a data dump
2. **Every risk must have a mitigation plan with an owner** — not just "risk exists"
3. **Every commitment must have a deadline and status** — not just "we owe them"
4. **Compare against last week** — is pipeline growing or shrinking?
5. **Be honest about losses** — don't bury them
6. **Resolve during synthesis** — create tasks, draft emails, update systems while building the brief
7. **Simplicity criterion** — if the brief is > 1 page, cut the noise. The CEO should scan this in 3 minutes.

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- [ ] All data sourced from live systems (not memory)
- [ ] Open loops identified and resolved where possible
- [ ] Every risk has a mitigation and owner
- [ ] Week-over-week comparison included
- [ ] Brief is scannable in < 3 minutes
- [ ] Systems updated during synthesis (not left as TODOs)
