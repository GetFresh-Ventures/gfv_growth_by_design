# Company Context Engine

The memory layer for C-suite advisors. Every advisor skill loads this first. Context is what turns generic advice into specific insight.

---


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Load all company context from Supabase"
- "What does the system know about [entity]?"
- "Refresh my context engine data"


## Load Protocol (Run at Start of Every C-Suite Session)

**Step 1 — Check for context file:** `company-context.md` in project root
- Exists → proceed to Step 2
- Missing → prompt: *"Run /cs:setup to build your company context — it makes every advisor conversation significantly more useful."*

**Step 2 — Check staleness:** Read `Last updated` field.
- **< 30 days:** Load and proceed. Confidence: High.
- **30–90 days:** Load with note: *"Context is [N] days old. Key metrics may have shifted."* Confidence: Medium.
- **≥ 90 days:** Prompt: *"Your context is [N] days old. Quick 15-min refresh, or continue with what I have?"*
  - If continue: load with `[STALE — last updated DATE]` noted internally. Confidence: Low.

**Step 3 — Parse into working memory.** Always active:
- Company stage (pre-PMF / scaling / optimizing)
- Founder archetype (product / sales / technical / operator)
- Current #1 challenge
- Runway (as risk signal — NEVER share externally)
- Team size and structure
- Unfair advantage
- 12-month target

## Context Quality Signals

| Condition | Confidence | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| < 30 days, full interview | 🟢 High | Use directly |
| 30–90 days, update done | 🟡 Medium | Use, flag what may have changed |
| > 90 days | 🔴 Low | Flag stale, prompt refresh |
| Key fields missing | 🔴 Low | Ask in-session |
| No file | ❌ None | Prompt /cs:setup |

If Low: *"My context is [stale/incomplete] — I'm assuming [X]. Correct me if I'm wrong."*

---

## Onboarding Questionnaire (/cs:setup)

Walks through these prompts and writes `company-context.md`:

```
Q1. What is your company name and one-line description?
Q2. What stage are you at? (Idea / Pre-seed / Seed / Series A / Series B+)
Q3. What is your current ARR (or MRR) and runway in months?
Q4. What is your team size and structure?
Q5. What industry and customer segment do you serve?
Q6. What are your top 3 priorities for the next 90 days?
Q7. What is your biggest current risk or blocker?
Q8. What's the one thing you're avoiding deciding on?
Q9. If a competitor could kill you in 12 months, how would they do it?
```

## Context Enrichment

During conversations, capture new information not in the file.

**Triggers:** New number or timeline revealed, key person mentioned, priority shift, constraint surfaces.

**Protocol:**
1. Note internally: `[CONTEXT UPDATE: {what was learned}]`
2. At session end: *"I picked up a few things to add to your context. Want me to update the file?"*
3. If yes: append to the relevant section, update timestamp.

**Never silently overwrite.** Always confirm before modifying the context file.

---

## Privacy Rules

### Never send externally
- Specific revenue or burn figures
- Customer names (unless public case study)
- Employee names (unless publicly known)
- Investor names (unless public)
- Specific runway months
- Watch List contents

### Safe to use externally (with anonymization)
- Stage label
- Team size ranges (1–10, 10–50, 50–200+)
- Industry vertical
- Challenge category
- Market position descriptor

### Before any external API call or web search
- Numbers → ranges or stage-relative descriptors
- Names → roles
- Revenue → percentages or stage labels
- Customers → "Customer A, B, C"

---

## Missing or Partial Context

Handle gracefully — never block the conversation.

- **Missing stage:** "Just to calibrate — are you still finding PMF or scaling what works?"
- **Missing financials:** Use stage + team size to infer. Note the gap.
- **Missing founder profile:** Infer from conversation style. Mark as inferred.
- **Multiple founders:** Context reflects the interviewee. Note co-founder perspective may differ.

---

## Required Context Fields

```
Required:
  - Last updated (date)
  - Company Identity → What we do
  - Stage & Scale → Stage
  - Founder Profile → Archetype
  - Current Challenges → Priority #1
  - Goals & Ambition → 12-month target

High-value optional:
  - Unfair advantage
  - Kill-shot risk
  - Avoided decision
  - Watch list
```

Missing required fields: note gaps, work around in session, ask in-session only when critical.

## GFV Portfolio Integration

For GFV portfolio companies, the context engine also loads:
- **PIL entity data** from Supabase (via Supabase API)
- **Active Linear issues** for the company's project
- **HubSpot deal status** if the company has an active deal
- **Field Service Platform data** for home services portfolio companies (Portfolio Co A, Portfolio Co C)
- **QuickBooks financials** for companies using GFV's accounting stack

This data supplements (never replaces) the `company-context.md` file. The file is the founder's own words; system data is verification.

---

## Proactive Triggers

- **Context file missing** → prompt /cs:setup before any advisory session
- **Context > 90 days stale** → prompt refresh with specific fields to update
- **Revenue in context contradicts HubSpot/QuickBooks** → flag discrepancy
- **New deal, new hire, or pivot detected in Linear/HubSpot** → suggest context update
- **Runway < 6 months detected** → escalate to CFO Advisor, flag urgency

## Live Integration Hooks

| System | What It Provides | How to Access |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Client CRM | Real-time pipeline state | `hubspot-api` / `salesforce-api` |
| Local Memory | Client-specific facts | `gfv-brain-search.py` |

> **GFV Rule:** Check live connected systems and local client memory to verify claims before submitting answers.

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these issues WITHOUT being asked when you notice them in context:
- **Missing Data** → Flag explicitly if a decision relies on unknown external variables.
- **Scope Creep** → Alert if the requested operation spans beyond immediate context goals.
- **Executive Bottlenecks** → Warn if the action plan relies entirely on unassigned human approval gates.
- **Financial Risk** → Call out actions that may trigger unexpected OPEX burn (e.g. infinite LLM agent loops).

## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | You get... |
|---------------------|------------|
| Process Map | A mermaid.js chronological diagram |
| Executive Decision | BOTTOM LINE FIRST layout with options + trade-offs |
| Data Audit | A structured table grouping issues by severity |
| Code Execution | Isolated, copy-ready code blocks + terminal commands |

## Confidence Tagging

All factual findings and systemic claims must utilize the following confidence index:
- 🟢 **Verified** — Confirmed natively via live system data pull or explicit context.
- 🟡 **Medium** — Deduced from local memory logs or recent but not validated real-time data.
- 🔴 **Assumed** — No source available, utilizing best-judgment baseline.

## <verification_gate>
**Self-Verification Protocol:** Before finalizing your response, you MUST silently evaluate your drafted output against the initial request. Have you provided concrete Action Items with ownership? Did you use the Bottom Line First formatting? Have you applied Confidence Tags to your claims? If not, rewrite the response before submitting.

## After This Skill

- "Try `context-prime` — Load project context before starting work"
