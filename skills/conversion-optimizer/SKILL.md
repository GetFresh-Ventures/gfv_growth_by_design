# Conversion Optimizer

Find and fix the leaks in your conversion funnel — forms, signups, landing pages, and onboarding.

## When to Activate

- Form conversion optimization (lead gen, contact forms)
- Signup/registration flow optimization
- Landing page CRO
- Post-signup onboarding optimization
- A/B test planning and analysis
- Funnel drop-off diagnosis

## Form CRO

### Reduce Fields

**Default rule: Every field you remove increases conversion.**

| Field Count | Typical Impact |
|-------------|----------------|
| 10+ fields | High abandonment, only for qualified leads |
| 5-7 fields | Standard for B2B, reasonable friction |
| 3-4 fields | Good for top-of-funnel |
| 1-2 fields | Best for newsletter, free tools |

### Field Optimization

- **Remove** fields you can get later (company size, industry — enrich with Clearbit)
- **Default** fields when possible (country from IP, timezone)
- **Conditional** fields (only show if relevant)
- **Inline validation** — Don't wait until submit to show errors
- **Smart placeholders** — Show format examples ("123-456-7890")

### Trust Signals Near Forms

- "No credit card required"
- Security badges (if collecting payment)
- Privacy statement (GDPR/CCPA)
- Social proof (customer count, logos)

### Abandoned Form Recovery

- **Exit-intent popup** — Offer something (discount, free resource)
- **Email capture first** — If multi-step, get email on step 1
- **Retargeting** — Pixel the form page for remarketing

## Signup Flow CRO

### Reduce Steps

Map the current flow and cut:
```
Landing Page → Signup Form → Email Verification → 
Profile Setup → Onboarding → First Value

Ask: Which steps can be deferred or removed?
```

### Key Principles

1. **Value before friction** — Show the product before asking for details
2. **Progressive profiling** — Collect info over time, not all at once
3. **Social login** — Google/GitHub SSO reduces friction significantly
4. **Clear progress** — Show step X of Y if multi-step is necessary
5. **Skip everything possible** — Pre-fill, default, or defer

## Landing Page CRO

### Above the Fold Checklist

- [ ] Clear headline (what you do + for whom)
- [ ] Subheadline (the benefit or proof point)
- [ ] One primary CTA (visible without scrolling)
- [ ] Social proof (customer logos, review count, testimonials)
- [ ] No navigation menu (or minimal — reduce exit paths)

### Page Structure

```
1. Hero (headline + CTA)
2. Social proof (logos or testimonial)
3. Problem agitation
4. Solution overview
5. How it works (3 steps)
6. Benefits (not features)
7. Case study / proof
8. Pricing (if applicable)
9. FAQ
10. Final CTA
```

### CTA Optimization

| Bad CTA | Better CTA |
|---------|-----------|
| "Submit" | "Get My Free Quote" |
| "Sign Up" | "Start Free Trial" |
| "Contact Us" | "Get a Response in 2 Hours" |
| "Learn More" | "See How It Works" |

## Onboarding CRO

### Time to First Value

**Goal: Get the user to their "aha moment" as fast as possible.**

1. Identify the activation event (what makes users stick)
2. Remove every step between signup and that event
3. Use checklists, not tutorials (people skip tutorials)
4. Celebrate completion (micro-animations, congratulations)

### Onboarding Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|------------|
| **Product tour** | Complex UI, first-time user |
| **Checklist** | Multiple setup steps required |
| **Empty state** | Guide through first action |
| **Template gallery** | Value comes from pre-built content |
| **Wizard flow** | Configuration-heavy products |

## A/B Testing Framework

### What to Test (Priority Order)

1. **Headlines** — Highest impact, easiest to test
2. **CTA text and color** — Direct conversion impact
3. **Form length** — Field count affects completion
4. **Social proof** — Type and placement
5. **Page layout** — Hero vs. no hero, long vs. short

### Test Design

- **One variable per test** — Isolate what matters
- **Minimum sample size** — 1,000+ visitors per variant for statistical significance
- **Run for full weeks** — Account for day-of-week variation
- **Measure primary metric only** — Don't declare victory on secondary metrics

## Diagnosis Workflow

When conversion is "bad," diagnose systematically:

1. **Where do people drop off?** — Funnel analytics (GA4, Hotjar)
2. **What do they see?** — Check mobile AND desktop experience
3. **What do they expect?** — Does the page match the ad/source?
4. **What stops them?** — Forms too long? Trust missing? Value unclear?
5. **What would help?** — Hypothesis → test → learn

## Quality Gate

Before delivering CRO recommendations:
- [ ] Based on data, not opinion (where possible)
- [ ] Prioritized by expected impact
- [ ] Each recommendation includes what to do and how to measure success
- [ ] Quick wins separated from bigger projects
- [ ] Mobile experience addressed (not just desktop)
