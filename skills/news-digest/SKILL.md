# News Digest

Produce a curated intelligence brief — not a raw RSS dump. Every item must be relevant to the CEO's active companies, deals, or competitive landscape.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "What's happening in [my industry] today?"
- "Build me a weekly industry digest"
- "Track news about [competitor]"


## When to Use

- Morning sweep (via `/chief-of-staff`)
- "What's happening in [industry/market]?"
- "Any news about [company/competitor]?"
- Pre-meeting research on a prospect or partner

## Step 1: Define the Watch List

Pull from the CEO's active context:

```bash
# Portfolio companies (from ~/gtm-brain/pipeline.md or CRM)
# Competitors (from ~/gtm-brain/competitive-landscape.md)
# Industries: home services, SaaS, AI/ML, private equity
# Key people: prospect CEOs, partner contacts
```

If no watch list exists, ask:
> "What companies, industries, or topics should I monitor? I'll build your watch list."

## Step 2: Source Intelligence

Use available tools in priority order:

| Source | Tool | What to extract |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Web search | `search_web` | Breaking news, funding rounds, acquisitions |
| Firecrawl | Firecrawl web scraping | Deep scrape of industry publications |
| HubSpot | CRM MCP tools | Prospect company news (for meeting prep) |
| Google News | `search_web` with `site:news.google.com` | General market signals |

**Query patterns:**
```
"[Company Name]" funding OR acquisition OR launch OR partnership
"[Industry]" market trends 2026
"[Competitor]" product launch OR pricing OR layoffs
```

## Step 3: Score Relevance

Every news item gets a relevance score:

| Score | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 🔴 **Direct** (5) | Mentions a portfolio company or active deal by name | Always include |
| 🟠 **Adjacent** (4) | Mentions a direct competitor or partner | Include with context |
| 🟡 **Market** (3) | Industry trend affecting the CEO's sectors | Include if actionable |
| ⚪ **Noise** (1-2) | General tech/business news | Exclude |

**Only items scoring 3+ make the digest.**

## Step 4: Format the Digest

```markdown
## Intelligence Digest — [Date]

### 🔴 Direct Impact
- **[Headline]** — [Source, Date]
  [1-sentence summary]. **Relevance:** [Why this matters to the CEO].
  **Action:** [What the CEO should consider doing]

### 🟠 Competitive Signals
- **[Headline]** — [Source, Date]
  [1-sentence summary]. **Watch:** [What to monitor next]

### 🟡 Market Trends
- **[Headline]** — [Source, Date]
  [1-sentence summary].

---
*[N] sources checked. [M] items scored 3+. Next digest: [tomorrow/date].*
```

## Rules

1. **No more than 7 items** — CEOs don't read newsletters, they scan
2. **Every item has a "why it matters" sentence** — raw headlines are useless
3. **Direct Impact items get an action suggestion** — "Consider reaching out to..."
4. **Date everything** — news loses value fast
5. **Never fabricate news** — if search returns nothing relevant, say "No significant signals today"

## Integration

- Feeds into `/audio-briefing` for the market section
- Triggered by `/chief-of-staff` morning sweep
- Items can feed `/meeting-prep` for upcoming calls with mentioned companies
- Save output to `~/ceo-brain/digests/` for trend tracking

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too much noise | Narrow your keywords — be specific to your niche, not just industry |
| Missing important stories | Add competitor names and key executive names to your watch list |
