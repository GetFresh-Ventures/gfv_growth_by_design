# PDF Toolkit

Process PDF files for CEO workflows — contracts, proposals, term sheets, and document management.

## When to Activate

- Reading or extracting text/tables from PDFs (contracts, reports, term sheets)
- Merging multiple PDFs (combining proposal + appendices)
- Splitting PDFs (extracting specific pages)
- Filling PDF forms (applications, compliance forms)
- Adding watermarks (DRAFT, CONFIDENTIAL)
- Encrypting/decrypting PDFs (secure document sharing)
- OCR on scanned PDFs (making scanned contracts searchable)
- Creating new PDFs from data

## Quick Reference

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Read/extract text | `pypdf` or `pdfplumber` |
| Merge PDFs | `pypdf` PdfWriter |
| Split PDF | `pypdf` per-page extraction |
| Fill forms | `pypdf` with AcroForm |
| Watermark | `reportlab` + `pypdf` |
| OCR scanned docs | `pytesseract` + `pdf2image` |
| Create new PDF | `reportlab` |

## Core Operations

### Extract Text
```python
from pypdf import PdfReader

reader = PdfReader("contract.pdf")
for page in reader.pages:
    text = page.extract_text()
    print(text)
```

### Merge PDFs
```python
from pypdf import PdfWriter, PdfReader

writer = PdfWriter()
for pdf in ["proposal.pdf", "appendix_a.pdf", "appendix_b.pdf"]:
    reader = PdfReader(pdf)
    for page in reader.pages:
        writer.add_page(page)

with open("combined_proposal.pdf", "wb") as f:
    writer.write(f)
```

### Split PDF
```python
reader = PdfReader("input.pdf")
for i, page in enumerate(reader.pages):
    writer = PdfWriter()
    writer.add_page(page)
    with open(f"page_{i+1}.pdf", "wb") as f:
        writer.write(f)
```

### Add Watermark
```python
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter
from pypdf import PdfWriter, PdfReader
import io

# Create watermark
packet = io.BytesIO()
c = canvas.Canvas(packet, pagesize=letter)
c.setFont("Helvetica", 60)
c.setFillAlpha(0.3)
c.translate(300, 400)
c.rotate(45)
c.drawCentredString(0, 0, "CONFIDENTIAL")
c.save()
packet.seek(0)

# Apply watermark
watermark = PdfReader(packet)
reader = PdfReader("document.pdf")
writer = PdfWriter()

for page in reader.pages:
    page.merge_page(watermark.pages[0])
    writer.add_page(page)

with open("watermarked.pdf", "wb") as f:
    writer.write(f)
```

### Fill PDF Forms
```python
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter

reader = PdfReader("form.pdf")
writer = PdfWriter()
writer.append(reader)

# Get form fields
fields = reader.get_form_text_fields()
print(f"Available fields: {list(fields.keys())}")

# Fill fields
writer.update_page_form_field_values(
    writer.pages[0],
    {
        "company_name": "GetFresh Ventures",
        "date": "2026-04-11",
        "signatory": "Diraj Goel"
    }
)

with open("filled_form.pdf", "wb") as f:
    writer.write(f)
```

### Encrypt PDF
```python
from pypdf import PdfWriter, PdfReader

reader = PdfReader("sensitive.pdf")
writer = PdfWriter()

for page in reader.pages:
    writer.add_page(page)

writer.encrypt("secure_password_here")

with open("encrypted.pdf", "wb") as f:
    writer.write(f)
```

### Extract Metadata
```python
reader = PdfReader("document.pdf")
meta = reader.metadata
print(f"Title: {meta.title}")
print(f"Author: {meta.author}")
print(f"Pages: {len(reader.pages)}")
```

## CEO-Specific Workflows

### Contract Review Prep
1. Extract all text from the contract PDF
2. Identify key terms: payment terms, termination clauses, IP ownership, non-compete
3. Flag unusual or non-standard clauses
4. Summarize in a decision-ready format

### Term Sheet Comparison
1. Extract text from multiple term sheets
2. Create comparison table: valuation, dilution, board seats, pro-rata, liquidation preference
3. Highlight material differences

### Document Assembly
1. Merge proposal + team bios + case studies + pricing into single PDF
2. Add page numbers and table of contents
3. Apply CONFIDENTIAL watermark if needed

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- [ ] All text extracted cleanly (no garbled characters)
- [ ] Merged PDFs maintain original formatting
- [ ] Form fields filled correctly
- [ ] Watermarks are visible but don't obscure content
- [ ] Encrypted files open with provided password
