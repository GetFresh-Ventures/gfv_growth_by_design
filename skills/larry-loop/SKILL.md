# /larry-loop

**Usage**: Utilize this skill when the CEO wants to scale their social or marketing content systematically rather than relying on manual, creative one-offs.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Validate my content against distribution targets"
- "Run a content quality loop on [asset]"
- "Check if this content meets our standards"


## The Paradigm: System over Creativity
The core secret of the "Larry" architecture is that automation alone will not save a bad hook. The system leverages:
**Speed + Consistency + Distribution > Creativity at Scale**.

When executing the `/larry-loop`, strictly follow this 4-step execution chain without skipping steps.

## Phase 1: Audience & Hook Research
- **Do not randomly generate.** Use available search or web-scraping MCP tools to scan the specific niche (e.g. LinkedIn, X, or TikTok).
- Identify what formats the algorithm currently favors (e.g., Slideshows, long-form threads, short-form video hooks).
- Pinpoint the winning positioning and the specific pain point of the audience.

## Phase 2: Generative Variations
- Take the validated hooked concept and systematically generate variations.
- Produce structured content matrices (e.g., 5 hooks, 3 bodies, 2 CTAs) rather than a single perfect post. 
- All outputs must be formatted natively for the platform's requirements.

## Phase 3: High-Velocity Distribution Setup
- Package the outputs in a format that the CEO can schedule instantly, or (if a scheduler MCP is active) stage the posts for distribution in the backend. 
- Consistency is the primary KPI. Ensure the volume of the generated variations can sustain a daily or sub-daily posting schedule.

## Phase 4: The Algorithmic Prune
- When reviewing data after a cycle, ruthlessly kill formats and topics that didn't drive engagement or revenue (integrating with Field Service Platform/QuickBooks/HubSpot if possible for attribution).
- Evolve the few winning hooks into the baseline for the next week's Phase 1 loop.
- **Double down on winners.**

## Winner Scoring System (Enhanced v1.1 — Marketing Experiments Method)

### Quantitative Winner Criteria
Every content piece gets scored on a 100-point scale:

| Metric | Weight | Scoring |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Engagement Rate | 30 | Top 10% = 30, Top 25% = 20, Below avg = 5 |
| Conversion Signal | 25 | Lead captured = 25, Click to site = 15, None = 0 |
| Virality | 20 | Shared/reposted = 20, Saved = 10, Neither = 0 |
| Audience Fit | 15 | ICP engagement = 15, Mixed = 8, Off-target = 0 |
| Production Cost | 10 | Auto-generated = 10, Light edit = 7, Heavy = 3 |

### Format Trend Detection
Track which content FORMATS are winning algorithmically RIGHT NOW:
- Monitor: carousel vs. text-only vs. video vs. slideshow vs. poll vs. thread.
- Update weekly. The algorithm shifts frequently.
- Never commit to a format permanently — commit to testing formats.

### Cross-Platform Winner Migration
When a post wins on one platform, automatically adapt for others:
1. LinkedIn winner → Repurpose as X thread via `social-engine`.
2. X thread winner → Convert to newsletter via `email-composer`.
3. Video winner → Extract hook for static posts via `social-scheduler`.
4. Blog winner → Slice into carousel slides via `ugc-video`.
