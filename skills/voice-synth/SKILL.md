# Voice Synthesis Content

Produce audio-ready scripts optimized for TTS engines or human narration. This skill handles the *content preparation* — actual voice rendering uses external services.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Prepare this brief for text-to-speech"
- "Convert my weekly report to audio format"
- "Optimize this script for spoken delivery"


## When to Use

- "Turn this into a podcast script"
- "Write a voiceover for this video"
- "Make an audio version of this brief"
- Content needs to be consumed hands-free
- Preparing scripts for `/audio-briefing` output

## Step 1: Identify the Format

| Format | Length | Tone | Pacing |
|--------|--------|------|--------|
| **Executive Brief** | 60-90 sec (~175 words) | Professional, concise | Fast — 170 WPM |
| **Podcast Intro** | 30-60 sec (~100 words) | Energetic, hook-driven | Medium — 150 WPM |
| **Video Voiceover** | Matches video length | Neutral, clear | Slow — 130 WPM |
| **Audio Newsletter** | 3-5 min (~500 words) | Conversational | Medium — 150 WPM |
| **Phone/IVR Script** | 15-30 sec (~50 words) | Calm, clear | Very slow — 120 WPM |

## Step 2: Write for the Ear

**Rules for spoken-word content:**

| Written | Spoken Equivalent |
|---------|------------------|
| $1,200 | twelve hundred dollars |
| 15% | fifteen percent |
| Q2 2026 | second quarter twenty twenty-six |
| CPA | cost per acquisition |
| e.g. | for example |
| etc. | and so on |
| vs. | versus |
| Dr. Smith | Doctor Smith |
| URLs | (omit entirely — can't click audio) |

**Structure rules:**
- One idea per sentence
- Max 15 words per sentence
- Use contractions (it's, we're, that's) — sounds natural
- Front-load the important word in each sentence
- Use transition phrases: "Now...", "Here's the key thing...", "Moving on..."

## Step 3: Add Pacing Markers

Use these inline markers for TTS engines and narrators:

```
[PAUSE 0.5]  — half-second pause (comma equivalent)
[PAUSE 1.0]  — one-second pause (period/section break)
[PAUSE 2.0]  — two-second pause (major section transition)
[EMPHASIS]   — stress the next word
[SLOW]       — reduce speed for complex content
[NORMAL]     — return to normal speed
```

**Example:**
```
Good morning. [PAUSE 1.0]

Here's what matters today. [PAUSE 0.5]

You have [EMPHASIS] three meetings on your calendar.
The first is at ten AM with the engineering team. [PAUSE 0.5]
They'll want a decision on the migration timeline. [PAUSE 1.0]

Moving on to pipeline. [PAUSE 0.5]
```

## Step 4: Pronunciation Guide

For proper nouns, technical terms, or ambiguous words, include a pronunciation block:

```
## Pronunciation Guide
- Asana: ah-SAH-nah
- Supabase: SOO-pah-bayse
- Vercel: vur-SELL
- Cron: KRON (rhymes with "on")
- OAuth: oh-AUTH
- GIF: JIF (or GIF — match CEO preference)
```

## Step 5: TTS Rendering Options

**macOS built-in:**
```bash
# List available voices
say -v '?'

# Render to file
say -v "Samantha" -r 170 -o output.aiff "$(cat script.txt)"

# Convert to MP3
afconvert output.aiff output.mp3 -f mp4f -d aac
```

**ElevenLabs (highest quality):**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/VOICE_ID" \
  -H "xi-api-key: $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "...", "model_id": "eleven_turbo_v2", "voice_settings": {"stability": 0.5, "similarity_boost": 0.75}}' \
  --output output.mp3
```

**OpenAI TTS:**
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
# Voices: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer
response = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="tts-1-hd",  # or tts-1 for faster/cheaper
    voice="onyx",
    speed=1.0,
    input=open("script.txt").read()
)
response.stream_to_file("output.mp3")
```

If no TTS service is configured, output the marked-up script only — it's still valuable for human narration.

## Output

Always deliver:
1. **The script** with pacing markers
2. **Pronunciation guide** (if proper nouns are present)
3. **Word count + estimated duration** at target WPM
4. **Audio file** (if TTS was used, with file path)

## Integration

- Called by `/audio-briefing` for morning brief narration
- Called by `/content-strategy` for audio content production
- Scripts saved to `~/ceo-brain/audio-scripts/` for reuse
