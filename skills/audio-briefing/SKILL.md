# Audio Briefing

Produce a structured, spoken-word briefing script the CEO can consume hands-free. This skill generates the *script* — actual text-to-speech rendering is handled by external TTS services (ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS, macOS `say`, etc.).


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Create an audio briefing for my commute"
- "Turn my weekly brief into a 5-minute audio script"
- "Prepare a voice briefing covering pipeline and meetings"

## When to Use

- "Give me my morning brief"
- "What do I need to know today?"
- "Summarize everything for my commute"
- Start of day when `/chief-of-staff` detects pending items

## Step 1: Gather Intelligence

Pull from available sources (skip any that aren't connected):

```
1. Calendar  → Next 3 meetings (title, time, attendee count)
2. Linear    → P0/P1 issues updated in last 24h
3. Pipeline  → ~/gtm-brain/pipeline.md (deals with activity)
4. Email     → Unread count + any flagged/urgent
5. News      → /news-digest output if available
```

**Time budget:** Spend no more than 30 seconds per source. If a source is slow or unavailable, skip it and note the gap.

## Step 2: Write the Script

**Format rules for spoken delivery:**

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Short sentences (under 15 words) | Easier to process aurally |
| No bullet points or tables | They don't translate to speech |
| Numbers spoken naturally | "about twelve hundred" not "1,200" |
| Spell out acronyms on first use | "P-zero" not "P0", "cost per acquisition" not "CPA" |
| Use transition phrases | "Moving on...", "Next up...", "One thing to flag..." |
| Total length: 60-90 seconds | ~150-225 words at speaking pace |

**Script structure:**

```markdown
## Executive Briefing — [Day, Month Date]

Good morning. Here's what matters today.

### Schedule
You have [N] meetings today. First up is [meeting] at [time]
with [key attendee]. [One sentence on what it's about or what to prepare.]

### Pipeline
[1-2 sentences on the most important pipeline movement.
Focus on what changed, not the full state.]

### Operations
[1-2 sentences on urgent tickets, blockers, or team items.
Only mention things that need action today.]

### One Thing to Watch
[The single most important non-urgent item the CEO should be
aware of. A risk, an opportunity, or a trend.]

That's your brief. Have a good one.
```

## Step 3: Render (Optional)

If the user wants actual audio output:

**macOS (built-in, no API key):**
```bash
say -v Samantha -r 170 -o ~/ceo-brain/briefing-$(date +%Y%m%d).aiff "$(cat briefing.txt)"
```

**ElevenLabs API (if configured):**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/VOICE_ID" \
  -H "xi-api-key: $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"text\": \"$(cat briefing.txt)\", \"model_id\": \"eleven_turbo_v2\"}" \
  --output ~/ceo-brain/briefing-$(date +%Y%m%d).mp3
```

**OpenAI TTS:**
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
response = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="tts-1",
    voice="onyx",
    input=open("briefing.txt").read()
)
response.stream_to_file("briefing.mp3")
```

If no TTS is configured, just output the script — it's still valuable as text.

## Output

Always produce:
1. **The script** (in the format above)
2. **Audio file path** (if TTS was used)
3. **Sources used** (which systems contributed data)
4. **Gaps** (which systems were unavailable)

## Integration

- Triggered by `/chief-of-staff` during morning sweep
- Feeds from `/news-digest` for the market section
- Feeds from `/pipeline-pulse` for deal updates
- Script saved to `~/ceo-brain/briefings/` for history

## Live Integration Hooks

| System | What It Provides | How to Access |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Client CRM | Real-time pipeline state | `hubspot-api` / `salesforce-api` |
| Local Memory | Client-specific facts | `gfv-brain-search.py` |

> **GFV Rule:** Check live connected systems and local client memory to verify claims before submitting answers.

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these issues WITHOUT being asked when you notice them in context:
- **Missing Data** → Flag explicitly if a decision relies on unknown external variables.
- **Scope Creep** → Alert if the requested operation spans beyond immediate context goals.
- **Executive Bottlenecks** → Warn if the action plan relies entirely on unassigned human approval gates.
- **Financial Risk** → Call out actions that may trigger unexpected OPEX burn (e.g. infinite LLM agent loops).

## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | You get... |
|---------------------|------------|
| Process Map | A mermaid.js chronological diagram |
| Executive Decision | BOTTOM LINE FIRST layout with options + trade-offs |
| Data Audit | A structured table grouping issues by severity |
| Code Execution | Isolated, copy-ready code blocks + terminal commands |

## Confidence Tagging

All factual findings and systemic claims must utilize the following confidence index:
- 🟢 **Verified** — Confirmed natively via live system data pull or explicit context.
- 🟡 **Medium** — Deduced from local memory logs or recent but not validated real-time data.
- 🔴 **Assumed** — No source available, utilizing best-judgment baseline.

## <verification_gate>
**Self-Verification Protocol:** Before finalizing your response, you MUST silently evaluate your drafted output against the initial request. Have you provided concrete Action Items with ownership? Did you use the Bottom Line First formatting? Have you applied Confidence Tags to your claims? If not, rewrite the response before submitting.

## After This Skill
💡 Suggest these next steps:
- "Want a detailed written version?" → `/weekly-ceo-brief`
- "Want me to prep for the meetings mentioned?" → `/meeting-prep`
