# Board Deck Builder

Build board decks that tell a story — not just show data. Every section has an owner, a narrative, and a "so what."


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Build my quarterly board deck"
- "Create an investor update for this month"
- "What metrics should I present to the board?"


## How This Skill Works

### Mode 1: Quarterly Board Deck
Full deck, all sections, 20-30 slides. Sent 48 hours in advance.

### Mode 2: Monthly Investor Update
Condensed — metrics dashboard, financials, pipeline, top risks. 8-12 slides.

### Mode 3: Fundraising Deck
Opens with market/vision, closes with ask. Designed to earn a follow-up meeting.

---

## Deck Structure (Standard Order)
Every section follows: **Headline → Data → Narrative → Ask/Next**

### 1. Executive Summary (CEO)
3 sentences. No more.
- Where we are
- Biggest thing that happened this period
- Where we're going next

*Bad:* "We had a good quarter with lots of progress across all areas."
*Good:* "We closed Q3 at $2.4M revenue (+22% QoQ), signed our largest contract, and enter Q4 with 14 months runway."

### 2. Key Metrics Dashboard
6-8 metrics max. Use a table with: Metric | This Period | Last Period | Target | Status (✅/🟡/❌)

### 3. Financial Update
- P&L summary: Revenue, COGS, Gross margin, OpEx, Net burn
- Cash position and runway (months)
- Variance to plan (what was different and WHY)
- Forecast update for next quarter

### 4. Revenue & Pipeline
- Revenue waterfall: starting → new → expansion → churn → ending
- Pipeline by stage (in $, not just count)
- Forecast with confidence level
- Top 3 deals: name/amount/close date/risk

### 5. Growth & Marketing
- CAC by channel
- Pipeline contribution by channel ($)
- What's working, what's being cut, what's being tested

### 6. Team & People
- Headcount: actual vs plan
- Key hires and open roles
- Attrition: regrettable vs non-regrettable

### 7. Strategic Outlook
- Next quarter priorities (3-5 items, ranked)
- Key decisions needed from the board
- **Asks** (the most important slide — be specific)

## Narrative Framework
**The 4-Act Structure:**
1. **Where we said we'd be** (last quarter's targets)
2. **Where we actually are** (honest assessment)
3. **Why the gap exists** (one cause per variance)
4. **What we're doing about it** (specific, dated actions)

## Delivering Bad News
1. **State it plainly** — "We missed target by $300K (12% gap)"
2. **Own the cause** — don't blame "market conditions"
3. **Show you understand it** — "We analyzed 8 deals; the pattern is X"
4. **Present the fix** — specific, dated changes
5. **Update the forecast** — with bottom-up build

## Common Board Deck Mistakes
| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too many slides (>25) | Cut ruthlessly |
| Metrics without targets | Every metric needs a target and status |
| No narrative | Data without story forces boards to draw their own conclusions |
| Burying bad news | Lead with it, own it, fix it |
| Vague asks | Specific, actionable, person-assigned asks only |
| No variance explanation | Every gap needs one-sentence cause |

## Live Integration Hooks
| System | Board Section | Skill |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| QuickBooks | Financials — P&L, cash, runway | quickbooks-api |
| HubSpot | Pipeline — deals, velocity, forecast | hubspot-api |
| Google Ads | Marketing — spend, CPA, ROAS | google-ads-connector |
| GA4 | Marketing — traffic, conversions | ga4-connector |
| Field Service Platform | Revenue — job data, avg ticket | field-service-connector |
| Linear | Product/Eng — sprint velocity, delivery | linear-mcp-server |

## Proactive Triggers
- **Board meeting in < 1 week with no deck** → start assembly now
- **Key metrics missing from data sources** → flag data gaps before assembly
- **Bad news detected in financials** → prep the bad-news delivery framework
- **No asks slide prepared** → boards expect asks, push for specifics
- **Last deck reused with just number updates** → narrative must be fresh

## Output Artifacts
| Request | You Produce |
|---------|-------------|
| "Build the board deck" | Full deck with all sections populated from live data |
| "Monthly investor update" | Condensed update with key metrics + narrative |
| "Fundraising deck" | Vision + market + metrics + ask |
| "How do I deliver bad news?" | Bad-news framework with specific scripts |

## Communication
- **Boards see 10+ decks per quarter — yours needs a through-line**
- **Confidence tagging** — 🟢 verified / 🟡 medium / 🔴 assumed
- **Opening frame:** Board should know the key message by slide 3

## Related Skills
- **ceo-advisor**: Use for strategic direction that informs the deck. NOT for deck assembly.
- **cfo-advisor**: Use for financial section depth. NOT for full deck coordination.
- **executive-mentor**: Use for stress-testing the deck before presenting. NOT for building it.
- **gfv-report-builder**: Use for generating branded visual slides. NOT for narrative strategy.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Board asks questions I can't answer | Include an appendix with detailed backup data for each key metric |
| Deck takes too long to build | Template it — same structure each quarter, just update the numbers |
