# Code Review

Perform a rigorous, structured review of code changes. Never rubber-stamp. Every review must produce actionable findings or an explicit clean bill.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Review this pull request"
- "Check this diff for issues"
- "Code review the changes in [branch]"


## When to Use

- User says "review this PR", "check my changes", "look at this diff"
- Before any merge to main/master
- After completing a major feature branch
- When another agent's output needs validation

## Step 1: Gather the Diff

```bash
# For a branch vs main
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git diff main...HEAD

# For staged changes
git diff --cached

# For a specific PR (GitHub CLI)
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER>

# For last N commits
git log --oneline -5
git diff HEAD~3..HEAD
```

Summarize: how many files changed, lines added/removed, which subsystems are touched.

## Step 2: Structural Scan

Before reading code line-by-line, answer these architectural questions:

| Question | What to check |
|----------|--------------|
| **Scope creep?** | Does the diff touch files unrelated to the stated goal? |
| **Missing tests?** | Are there new functions/endpoints without corresponding test files? |
| **Config drift?** | Are there changes to `.env`, `config`, or infra files mixed with feature code? |
| **Migration safety?** | Database schema changes — are they reversible? |
| **Dependency changes?** | New packages added to `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`? |

## Step 3: Line-by-Line Review

For each changed file, evaluate against this checklist:

### Correctness
- [ ] Logic handles edge cases (null, empty, negative, overflow)
- [ ] Error paths return meaningful messages, not silent failures
- [ ] Async operations have proper error handling and timeouts
- [ ] Types are correct (no implicit `any`, no wrong casts)

### Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- [ ] User input is validated/sanitized before use
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] File paths are validated (no path traversal)
- [ ] Auth checks exist on protected endpoints

### Performance
- [ ] No N+1 query patterns
- [ ] No unbounded loops or recursive calls without limits
- [ ] Large data sets use pagination or streaming
- [ ] Expensive operations aren't inside hot loops

### Maintainability
- [ ] Functions are under 50 lines (split if larger)
- [ ] Variable names describe intent, not implementation
- [ ] No duplicated logic that should be extracted
- [ ] Comments explain *why*, not *what*

## Step 4: Classify Findings

Every finding gets a severity:

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Will cause crashes, data loss, or security vulnerabilities | Must fix before merge |
| 🟠 **Important** | Incorrect behavior, missing error handling, test gaps | Should fix before merge |
| 🟡 **Minor** | Style issues, naming, minor optimization opportunities | Fix at author's discretion |
| 💡 **Suggestion** | Alternative approaches, future improvements | No action required |

## Step 5: Produce the Review

Output format — always use this structure:

```markdown
## Code Review: [Branch/PR Name]

**Scope:** [N files, +X/-Y lines, subsystems touched]
**Verdict:** 🟢 Approve / 🟡 Approve with comments / 🔴 Request changes

### Findings

#### 🔴 Critical
- **[filename:line]** — [description of issue]
  - **Why:** [impact if not fixed]
  - **Fix:** [concrete suggestion]

#### 🟠 Important
- ...

#### 🟡 Minor
- ...

#### 💡 Suggestions
- ...

### What's Good
- [Specific praise for well-written code, good patterns, thorough tests]
```

## Red Flags — Stop and Escalate

- Diff includes `.env` files with real values → **Block immediately**
- Diff deletes tests without replacing them → **Request justification**
- Single commit touches 20+ files across unrelated systems → **Request split**
- No tests for new public API surface → **Block until covered**

## Integration

- Chain with `/commit-fast` after review passes
- Chain with `/analyze-issue` if review uncovers a bug
- Use `project-release` skill when review is the final gate before release

## Live Integration Hooks

| System | What It Provides | How to Access |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Client CRM | Real-time pipeline state | `hubspot-api` / `salesforce-api` |
| Local Memory | Client-specific facts | `gfv-brain-search.py` |

> **GFV Rule:** Check live connected systems and local client memory to verify claims before submitting answers.

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these issues WITHOUT being asked when you notice them in context:
- **Missing Data** → Flag explicitly if a decision relies on unknown external variables.
- **Scope Creep** → Alert if the requested operation spans beyond immediate context goals.
- **Executive Bottlenecks** → Warn if the action plan relies entirely on unassigned human approval gates.
- **Financial Risk** → Call out actions that may trigger unexpected OPEX burn (e.g. infinite LLM agent loops).

## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | You get... |
|---------------------|------------|
| Process Map | A mermaid.js chronological diagram |
| Executive Decision | BOTTOM LINE FIRST layout with options + trade-offs |
| Data Audit | A structured table grouping issues by severity |
| Code Execution | Isolated, copy-ready code blocks + terminal commands |

## Confidence Tagging

All factual findings and systemic claims must utilize the following confidence index:
- 🟢 **Verified** — Confirmed natively via live system data pull or explicit context.
- 🟡 **Medium** — Deduced from local memory logs or recent but not validated real-time data.
- 🔴 **Assumed** — No source available, utilizing best-judgment baseline.

## <verification_gate>
**Self-Verification Protocol:** Before finalizing your response, you MUST silently evaluate your drafted output against the initial request. Have you provided concrete Action Items with ownership? Did you use the Bottom Line First formatting? Have you applied Confidence Tags to your claims? If not, rewrite the response before submitting.
