# Sales Enablement

Build sales collateral that helps reps close deals — not marketing theater.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Create a one-pager for [product]"
- "Build a pitch deck for [audience]"
- "Write battle cards against [competitor]"


## When to Activate

- Creating sales decks, one-pagers, or leave-behinds
- Building objection handling docs
- Writing demo scripts or talk tracks
- Designing ROI calculators
- Building sales playbooks for new hires or new markets
- Creating buyer persona cards
- Building proposal templates

## Before Starting

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

1. **Value Proposition & Differentiators** — What do you sell and who is it for?
2. **Top 3 Objections** — What pushback do reps hear most?
3. **Competitors** — Who are you compared against? How do you win?
4. **Pricing** — How is the product priced? What's the typical deal size?
5. **Buyer Personas** — Who are you selling to? (title, seniority, department)

## Collateral Types

### Sales Deck (Slide-by-Slide)

Recommended flow:
1. **Title slide** — Company name, tagline, date
2. **The problem** — Describe the pain your prospect feels. Use their words.
3. **Why now** — Market shift, regulatory change, competitive pressure
4. **Solution overview** — What you do in one clean sentence
5. **How it works** — 3-4 key capabilities mapped to their pain
6. **Proof** — Metrics, case study, customer logos
7. **Differentiation** — Why you, not the alternative
8. **Pricing** — Transparent, tied to value
9. **Next steps** — One concrete ask

**Deliver as:** Slide-by-slide outline with headline, body copy, and speaker notes.

### One-Pager

Structure:
- **Headline** — The promise in one sentence
- **The problem** — 2-3 sentences, their perspective
- **The solution** — What you do, how it works (with visual if possible)
- **Key benefits** — 3 bullets, outcome-focused
- **Proof point** — One customer result with metrics
- **CTA** — What to do next

### Objection Handling Doc

Table format for each objection:

| Objection | Response | Proof Point | Follow-Up Question |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------------------|
| "Too expensive" | Frame as investment, show ROI | Customer X saved $Y/year | "What's the cost of not solving this?" |
| "We're not ready" | Acknowledge timing, show risk of delay | Competitor Z just launched | "When would be the right time?" |

### ROI Calculator

**Inputs** (metrics the prospect provides):
- Time spent on manual processes
- Current tool costs
- Error rates or inefficiency metrics
- Team size

**Calculations:**
- Time saved per week/month/year
- Cost reduction (tools, headcount, errors)
- Revenue impact (faster deals, higher conversion)

**Outputs:**
- Annual ROI percentage
- Payback period in months
- Total 3-year value

### Demo Scripts

Structure:
1. **Opening** (2 min) — Context, agenda, confirm goals
2. **Discovery recap** (3 min) — Summarize what you learned, confirm priorities
3. **Solution walkthrough** (15-20 min) — 3-4 key workflows mapped to their pain
4. **Interaction points** — Questions to ask during the demo
5. **Close** (5 min) — Summarize value, propose next steps with timeline

### Buyer Persona Cards

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Role / title | Common titles and reporting structure |
| Goals | What success looks like for them |
| Pains | What frustrates them daily |
| Top objections | 3-5 objections from this role |
| Evaluation criteria | How they judge solutions |
| Buying process | Their role in the decision |
| Messaging angle | The one sentence that resonates most |

**Persona types:** Economic buyer, Technical buyer, End user, Champion, Blocker

### Sales Playbook

Contents:
- **Buyer profile** — Who you're selling to, goals and pains
- **Qualification criteria** — BANT, MEDDIC, or your framework
- **Discovery questions** — By topic, not a script
- **Objection handling** — Top 10 with responses
- **Competitive positioning** — How you win against each competitor
- **Demo flow** — By persona
- **Email templates** — Follow-up, proposal, check-in, breakup

### Proposal Templates

Structure:
1. **Executive summary** — Their challenge, your solution, expected outcome (1 page max)
2. **Proposed solution** — Mapped to their requirements
3. **Implementation plan** — Timeline, milestones, responsibilities
4. **Investment** — Pricing, payment terms, inclusions
5. **Next steps** — How to move forward

## Output Format

| Asset | Deliverable |
|-------|-------------|
| Sales deck | Slide-by-slide with headline, copy, speaker notes |
| One-pager | Full copy with layout guidance |
| Objection doc | Table: objection, response, proof, follow-up |
| Demo script | Scene-by-scene with timing and talk track |
| ROI calculator | Input fields, formulas, sample data |
| Playbook | Structured doc with ToC |
| Persona card | One-page card per persona |
| Proposal | Section-by-section with customization notes |

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- [ ] All claims are backed by data or customer evidence
- [ ] Language is prospect-facing, not internal jargon
- [ ] One clear CTA per asset
- [ ] Competitive positioning is factual, not trash-talk
- [ ] Reps can use this in the next call without modification

## Live Integration Hooks

| System | What It Provides | How to Access |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Client CRM | Real-time pipeline state | `hubspot-api` / `salesforce-api` |
| Local Memory | Client-specific facts | `gfv-brain-search.py` |

> **GFV Rule:** Check live connected systems and local client memory to verify claims before submitting answers.

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these issues WITHOUT being asked when you notice them in context:
- **Missing Data** → Flag explicitly if a decision relies on unknown external variables.
- **Scope Creep** → Alert if the requested operation spans beyond immediate context goals.
- **Executive Bottlenecks** → Warn if the action plan relies entirely on unassigned human approval gates.
- **Financial Risk** → Call out actions that may trigger unexpected OPEX burn (e.g. infinite LLM agent loops).

## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | You get... |
|---------------------|------------|
| Process Map | A mermaid.js chronological diagram |
| Executive Decision | BOTTOM LINE FIRST layout with options + trade-offs |
| Data Audit | A structured table grouping issues by severity |
| Code Execution | Isolated, copy-ready code blocks + terminal commands |

## Confidence Tagging

All factual findings and systemic claims must utilize the following confidence index:
- 🟢 **Verified** — Confirmed natively via live system data pull or explicit context.
- 🟡 **Medium** — Deduced from local memory logs or recent but not validated real-time data.
- 🔴 **Assumed** — No source available, utilizing best-judgment baseline.

## <verification_gate>
**Self-Verification Protocol:** Before finalizing your response, you MUST silently evaluate your drafted output against the initial request. Have you provided concrete Action Items with ownership? Did you use the Bottom Line First formatting? Have you applied Confidence Tags to your claims? If not, rewrite the response before submitting.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Sales reps don't use the materials | Ask reps what they actually need — build bottom-up, not top-down |
| Collateral feels outdated | Set a quarterly refresh cadence. Link docs to your CRM for visibility |
