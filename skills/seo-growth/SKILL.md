# SEO Growth

Diagnose SEO issues and implement fixes that move rankings, not just check boxes.

## When to Activate

- Auditing SEO technical health
- Diagnosing traffic drops or ranking losses
- Implementing structured data / schema markup
- Planning site architecture and URL structure
- Optimizing for AI search engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, Gemini)
- Building internal linking strategy
- Identifying keyword cannibalization

## SEO Audit Framework

### 1. Technical SEO

Diagnose infrastructure issues that prevent indexing:

| Check | How | Fix |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **Crawlability** | Check robots.txt, XML sitemap | Ensure all important pages are crawlable |
| **Indexation** | `site:domain.com` in Google | Submit missing pages via GSC |
| **Page Speed** | Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP) | Optimize images, defer JS, fix layout shifts |
| **Mobile** | Mobile-friendly test | Responsive design, tap targets, font sizes |
| **HTTPS** | Check SSL cert | Force HTTPS redirect |
| **Canonical tags** | Check for duplicates | Add canonical to preferred version |
| **404 errors** | GSC Coverage report | 301 redirect or restore content |

### 2. On-Page SEO

Optimize individual page elements:

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| **Title tag** | Primary keyword + brand, 50-60 chars |
| **Meta description** | Action-oriented, 150-160 chars |
| **H1** | One per page, includes primary keyword |
| **Heading hierarchy** | H1 → H2 → H3, logical structure |
| **Internal links** | 3-5 per page to related content |
| **Image alt text** | Descriptive, includes keyword when natural |
| **URL structure** | Short, descriptive, includes keyword |

### 3. Content Quality (E-E-A-T)

Google evaluates Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust:

- **Experience**: Show first-hand experience with the topic
- **Expertise**: Author credentials visible, bio pages
- **Authoritativeness**: Backlinks, citations, brand mentions
- **Trust**: Accurate info, secure site, transparent business info

## Schema Markup Implementation

### Common Schema Types

```json
// LocalBusiness (for service companies)
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Company Name",
  "address": { ... },
  "telephone": "...",
  "openingHours": "Mo-Fr 08:00-17:00",
  "priceRange": "$$"
}

// FAQ (for rich snippets)
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "How much does X cost?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "..."
    }
  }]
}

// Service (for service pages)
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Service",
  "name": "HVAC Installation",
  "provider": { ... },
  "areaServed": { ... }
}
```

### Schema Validation
- Test with [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- Validate with [Schema.org Validator](https://validator.schema.org/)

## Site Architecture Planning

### URL Structure
```
domain.com/
├── /services/
│   ├── /services/plumbing/
│   ├── /services/heating/
│   └── /services/cooling/
├── /locations/
│   ├── /locations/salt-lake-city/
│   └── /locations/des-moines/
├── /blog/
│   ├── /blog/category-1/
│   └── /blog/category-2/
└── /about/
```

### Internal Linking Strategy
- Hub pages link to all cluster pages
- Cluster pages link back to hub
- Related cluster pages cross-link
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")

## AI Search Optimization

Optimize for AI search engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, Google AI Overviews):

1. **Answer questions directly** — AI search pulls concise, authoritative answers
2. **Structure content with clear headers** — AI extracts by section
3. **Use statistics and data** — AI prefers citable facts
4. **Build topical authority** — Deep coverage of a topic increases citation likelihood
5. **Get cited in Wikipedia, Reddit, forums** — AI trains on these sources
6. **Maintain E-E-A-T signals** — Author bios, credentials, first-hand experience

## Traffic Drop Diagnosis

When traffic drops, check in order:
1. **Google algorithm update?** — Check industry news, MozCast
2. **Indexing issue?** — GSC Coverage report
3. **Technical problem?** — Server errors, redirect loops, robots.txt changes
4. **Content decay?** — Pages losing freshness signals
5. **Competitor surge?** — New competitor ranking for your keywords
6. **Seasonality?** — Compare to same period last year

## Quality Gate

Before delivering SEO recommendations:
- [ ] Prioritized by impact (not just easy wins)
- [ ] Technical issues ranked before content issues
- [ ] Specific URLs identified (not generic advice)
- [ ] Schema validated with testing tools
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable (who does what, by when)
