# /cron-scheduler

**Usage**: Utilize this skill when the CEO wants to automate a recurring execution loop (e.g., pulling a pipeline report every Friday, syncing memory daily).


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Set up a daily report at 8am"
- "Schedule a weekly database backup"
- "Create a recurring task that runs every hour"


## ⚠️ The Silent Failure Protocol

Unmonitored scheduled background jobs inevitably fail without notification. To comply with the GFV Execution Paradigm, the agent MUST construct crons using a **Verification Loop**, meaning the cron task must pipe its final status (Success/Fail) directly into `~/gtm-brain/logs` or send a Slack/Email output.

## Phase 1: Environment Definition
- Verify what OS the user is running (Mac/Linux `crontab`, Windows Task Scheduler).
- Evaluate if the script to be scheduled requires isolated dependencies (e.g., Python venv paths, active API environment variables).
- Formulate the absolute paths for the command logic.

## Phase 2: Generation of the Shell Output
- Generate a wrapping shell script that acts as the entry point. The script MUST contain a `try/catch` equivalent.
- `echo` the exact cron format expression out to the CEO.
- Include instructions on how the CEO can use `crontab -e` to install it, or offer to use the Terminal MCP to inject it directly if running locally.

## Phase 3: The Verification Pipeline
- Every scheduled task built automatically generates an artifact logging format. Upon running, if it fails, it must write a status text file that the `chief-of-staff` heartbeat capability can pick up the next morning.

## Phase 4: Silent Failure Diagnostics (Enhanced v1.1 — Cron Debugger Method)

When a cron job stops producing output, diagnose in this exact order:

### The 6-Layer Debug Checklist
1. **Crontab Registration** — Is the job actually in `crontab -l`? (Most common failure: it was never added.)
2. **Dispatcher Sync** — If using a dispatcher/scheduler, is it registered there AND in crontab?
3. **Python/Script Path** — Is the interpreter path absolute? Does it match the venv? Run `which python3` inside the cron environment.
4. **Missing Packages** — Does the script import packages only installed in a venv that cron doesn't activate?
5. **.env Loading** — Cron jobs do NOT inherit shell environment. Is `.env` loaded explicitly in the wrapper script?
6. **Stale Cache** — Python bytecode cache (`__pycache__`) can mask code changes. Clear and re-run.

### Diagnostic Output
```
[CRON DIAGNOSTIC: job_name]
Layer 1 - Crontab: ✅ Registered | ❌ Missing
Layer 2 - Dispatcher: ✅ Synced | ❌ Out of sync | ⚠️ No dispatcher
Layer 3 - Script Path: ✅ Absolute | ❌ Relative path
Layer 4 - Dependencies: ✅ All found | ❌ Missing: [list]
Layer 5 - Environment: ✅ .env loaded | ❌ Missing vars: [list]
Layer 6 - Cache: ✅ Clean | ❌ Stale bytecode detected
```

## Phase 5: Safe Registration Protocol (Enhanced v1.1 — Add Cron Job Method)

Before adding any new cron job, complete this checklist:

1. **Script Verification** — Run the script manually once. Confirm it produces expected output.
2. **Time Conflict Check** — Query existing crontab for jobs running at the same time. Avoid resource contention.
3. **Dispatcher Registration** — If a dispatcher exists, register there FIRST, then crontab.
4. **Dry Run** — Add the cron entry with output redirected to a test log. Wait for one cycle. Verify the log.
5. **Monitoring Hook** — Ensure the `chief-of-staff` heartbeat can detect if this job fails silently.
