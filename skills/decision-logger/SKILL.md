# Decision Logger

Two-layer memory system. Layer 1 stores everything. Layer 2 stores only what the CEO approved. Future sessions read Layer 2 only — this prevents hallucinated consensus from past debates bleeding into new deliberations.

---


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Log this decision: We're going with [Vendor] for [reason]"
- "What decisions have I made this month?"
- "Show me the context behind the [topic] decision"

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `/cs:decisions` | Last 10 approved decisions |
| `/cs:decisions --all` | Full history |
| `/cs:decisions --owner CMO` | Filter by owner |
| `/cs:decisions --topic pricing` | Search by keyword |
| `/cs:review` | Action items due within 7 days |
| `/cs:review --overdue` | Items past deadline |

## Two-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1 — Raw Transcripts
**Location:** `memory/consultations/YYYY-MM-DD-raw.md`
- Full agent contributions, critique, synthesis
- All debates, including rejected arguments
- **NEVER auto-loaded.** Only on explicit CEO request.
- Archive after 90 days → `memory/consultations/archive/YYYY/`

### Layer 2 — Approved Decisions
**Location:** `memory/consultations/decisions.md`
- ONLY CEO-approved decisions, action items, corrections
- **Loaded automatically at start of every advisory session**
- Append-only. Decisions are never deleted — only superseded.
- Managed by Chief of Staff after CEO approval. Never written by agents directly.

---

## Decision Entry Format

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] — [TOPIC TITLE]

**Decision:** [One clear statement of what was decided.]
**Owner:** [One person or role — accountable for execution.]
**Deadline:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Review:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Rationale:** [Why this over alternatives. 1-2 sentences.]

**CEO Override:** [If CEO changed agent recommendation — what and why. Blank if not applicable.]

**Rejected:**
- [Proposal] — [reason] [DO_NOT_RESURFACE]

**Action Items:**
- [ ] [Action] — Owner: [name] — Due: [YYYY-MM-DD] — Review: [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Supersedes:** [DATE of previous decision on same topic, if any]
**Superseded by:** [Filled in retroactively if overridden later]
**Raw transcript:** memory/consultations/[DATE]-raw.md
```

---

## Conflict Detection

Before logging, Chief of Staff checks for:

1. **DO_NOT_RESURFACE violations** — new decision matches a rejected proposal
2. **Topic contradictions** — two active decisions on same topic with different conclusions
3. **Owner conflicts** — same action assigned to different people in different decisions

When a conflict is found:
```
⚠️ DECISION CONFLICT
New: [text]
Conflicts with: [DATE] — [existing text]

Options: (1) Supersede old  (2) Merge  (3) Defer to CEO
```

**DO_NOT_RESURFACE enforcement:**
```
🚫 BLOCKED: "[Proposal]" was rejected on [DATE]. Reason: [reason].
To reopen: CEO must explicitly say "reopen [topic] from [DATE]".
```

---

## Logging Workflow (Post Consultation)

1. CEO approves synthesis
2. Write Layer 1 raw transcript → `YYYY-MM-DD-raw.md`
3. Check conflicts against `decisions.md`
4. Surface conflicts → wait for CEO resolution
5. Append approved entries to `decisions.md`
6. Confirm: decisions logged, actions tracked, DO_NOT_RESURFACE flags added

---

## Marking Actions Complete

```markdown
- [x] [Action] — Owner: [name] — Completed: [DATE] — Result: [one sentence]
```

Never delete completed items. The history is the record.

---

## Session Start Protocol

At the start of every advisory session:

1. Load `decisions.md` (Layer 2)
2. Check for overdue action items
3. Check for review dates that have passed
4. If overdue items exist, flag them:
   *"You decided [X] on [date] with a review date of [date]. Worth a check-in?"*

---

## File Structure

```
memory/consultations/
├── decisions.md              # Layer 2: append-only, CEO-approved
├── YYYY-MM-DD-raw.md         # Layer 1: full transcript per session
└── archive/YYYY/             # Raw files after 90 days
```

---

## GFV System Sync

When a decision is logged:
- **If it involves a task:** Create or update a Linear issue
- **If it involves a deal:** Update HubSpot deal notes
- **If it involves a person/entity:** Update PIL entity facts in Supabase
- **Three-System Sync Rule applies:** Linear + HubSpot + PIL — all three or none.

---

## Proactive Triggers

- **Overdue action item** → flag at session start with days past due
- **Review date passed** → prompt check-in
- **Same topic raised 3+ times without decision** → escalate with cost of delay
- **DO_NOT_RESURFACE violation attempted** → block and explain
- **No new decisions in 2+ weeks** → prompt decision audit
- **Contradictory decision detected** → surface conflict before logging

## Team Activity Log (Enhanced v1.1 — Shared Log Method)

### Cross-Session Sync Protocol
When multiple agents or human collaborators are working across sessions:

1. **After Every Change or Decision**, append a timestamped entry:
```markdown
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] [AGENT/PERSON] [ACTION_TYPE] — [Description]
```

2. **Action Types**:
   - `DECISION` — A choice was made.
   - `CHANGE` — Code, config, or process was modified.
   - `DISCOVERY` — New information surfaced.
   - `BLOCKER` — Something is stuck.
   - `HANDOFF` — Work passed to another agent/person.

3. **Sync Points**:
   - On session start: Read the last 10 log entries to regain context.
   - On session end: Write a summary entry capturing what was accomplished.
   - On handoff: Write explicit handoff entry with next steps.

### Log Location
```
memory/team_activity_log.md  # Append-only, never delete entries
```

This ensures that no matter which agent or person picks up work next, they can immediately see what happened and what's pending.

## After This Skill
💡 Suggest these next steps:
- "Want me to draft a communication about this decision?" → `/email-composer`
- "Want me to update the pipeline?" → `/pipeline-pulse`
