# Post-Meeting Brief

Turn meeting notes into system-level action within 15 minutes. A meeting note is NOT "handled" just because it was read — it's handled when all outputs are pushed into live systems.

## When to Activate

- Immediately after any client, prospect, or partner meeting
- When Fathom/Otter transcript arrives
- When manual notes are provided (bullets, stream of consciousness)
- During heartbeat sweeps when unprocessed meeting notes are detected

## The Non-Negotiable Rule

**A meeting note is NOT handled until:**
- [ ] Tasks are created in Linear (with correct assignee and due date)
- [ ] Deal state is updated in HubSpot (stage, amount, close date)
- [ ] Follow-up events are on the calendar
- [ ] Follow-up email is drafted (using `email-composer` rules)
- [ ] Any commitments made are tracked

Reading ≠ Processing. Summarizing ≠ Processing. Only action counts.

## Processing Workflow

### Step 1: Ingest Meeting Content

Accept from any format:
- Fathom AI transcript/summary
- Manual bullet notes
- Stream of consciousness voice dump
- Calendar event + verbal debrief

### Step 2: Extract Intelligence

Look specifically for:
- **Explicit action items** — things someone said they'd do
- **Implied follow-ups** — things that clearly need to happen even if nobody said "action item"
- **Deadlines** — any dates or time commitments mentioned
- **Promises the CEO made** — commitments Diraj owes
- **Introductions to send** — people to connect
- **Documents/materials to share** — decks, proposals, files promised
- **Scheduling next steps** — when to meet again
- **Deal-state changes** — stage movement, pricing discussions, new information
- **Key learnings** — things about the prospect/client we didn't know before

### Step 3: Classify and Route

For each extracted item, classify through the priority map:
- **P0 items** → Create immediately, alert Diraj
- **P1 items** → Create task, include in summary
- **P2 items** → Create task with future due date
- **Auto-resolvable** → Handle directly (send intro, update tracker, schedule follow-up)

### Step 4: Update ALL Live Systems

In the same turn:
1. **Linear** → Create tasks with owner + deadline
2. **HubSpot** → Update deal stage/amount/close date if changed
3. **Calendar** → Book follow-up meeting if agreed
4. **Email** → Draft follow-up email for Diraj's approval
5. **PIL** → Log key relationship insights

### Step 5: Output Brief

```markdown
# Post-Meeting Brief: [Company] — [Date]

## Meeting Details
- **Attendees**: [names and roles]
- **Duration**: [length]
- **Type**: [Discovery / Follow-up / Negotiation / Close]

## Key Decisions Made
1. [Decision with context]

## Action Items Created

### Ours (commit tracker)
| Action | Owner | Deadline | System Updated |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| [item] | Diraj | [date] | ✅ Linear GFV-XXX |

### Theirs (we verify)
| Action | Who | Expected By |
|--------|-----|-------------|

## Deal Impact
- **Stage change**: [Yes/No — Linear + HubSpot updated]
- **Amount change**: [Yes/No]
- **Close date**: [Confirmed / Moved / At risk]
- **Next meeting**: [Scheduled on calendar? When?]

## Key Insights (for PIL)
- [Learning about their business/needs]
- [Buying signal or concern]

## Follow-Up Email Draft
[Draft below — awaiting Diraj's "send it" approval]
```

## Auto-Resolve Bias

Meeting notes often contain operational follow-ups that can be auto-resolved:
- ✅ Add tasks for Diraj or the assistant
- ✅ Create follow-up reminders
- ✅ Update deal tracker after outcome is clear
- ✅ Schedule follow-up when time was agreed
- ❌ Draft-first: investor/board messaging, legal wording, pricing commitments
- ❌ Escalate: unclear commitments, ambiguous outcomes

## Quality Gate

Before marking a meeting note as processed:
- [ ] Every action item has an owner AND deadline
- [ ] All affected systems (Linear, HubSpot, Calendar) are updated
- [ ] Follow-up email references specific meeting content
- [ ] Deal impact is honestly assessed (not just "went well")
- [ ] Key insights logged for future reference
- [ ] CEO has received the brief with draft email for approval
