# Doc Builder

Create professional Word documents that CEOs can send to clients, investors, and partners.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Create a proposal document for [Client]"
- "Build a one-pager summarizing our Q2 results"
- "Turn these bullet points into a professional memo"

## When to Activate

- Creating proposals, SOWs, or engagement letters
- Writing formal memos, reports, or board documents
- Generating executive summaries as `.docx`
- Building document templates (NDA template, proposal template)
- Editing existing Word documents (tracked changes, comments)
- Converting content into polished Word format

## Workflow

### Reading Content
```bash
# Text extraction with tracked changes
pandoc --track-changes=all document.docx -o output.md

# Direct Python extraction
python -c "
from docx import Document
doc = Document('document.docx')
for para in doc.paragraphs:
    print(para.text)
"
```

### Creating New Documents (Python + python-docx)
```python
from docx import Document
from docx.shared import Inches, Pt, Cm, RGBColor
from docx.enum.text import WD_ALIGN_PARAGRAPH
from docx.enum.style import WD_STYLE_TYPE

doc = Document()

# Title
title = doc.add_heading('Executive Proposal', level=0)
title.alignment = WD_ALIGN_PARAGRAPH.CENTER

# Subtitle with custom formatting
subtitle = doc.add_paragraph()
subtitle.alignment = WD_ALIGN_PARAGRAPH.CENTER
run = subtitle.add_run('Prepared for [Client Name]')
run.font.size = Pt(14)
run.font.color.rgb = RGBColor(0x66, 0x66, 0x66)

# Body text
doc.add_heading('Executive Summary', level=1)
doc.add_paragraph(
    'This proposal outlines our recommended approach...'
)

# Table
table = doc.add_table(rows=4, cols=3)
table.style = 'Light Grid Accent 1'
headers = table.rows[0].cells
headers[0].text = 'Deliverable'
headers[1].text = 'Timeline'
headers[2].text = 'Investment'

# Page break
doc.add_page_break()

# Save
doc.save('proposal.docx')
```

### Creating Documents (JavaScript + docx-js for complex layouts)
```javascript
const { Document, Packer, Paragraph, TextRun, HeadingLevel,
        AlignmentType, PageBreak, Table, TableRow, TableCell } = require('docx');

const doc = new Document({
    sections: [{
        properties: {},
        children: [
            new Paragraph({
                text: "Executive Proposal",
                heading: HeadingLevel.TITLE,
                alignment: AlignmentType.CENTER,
            }),
            new Paragraph({
                children: [
                    new TextRun({
                        text: "Prepared by GetFresh Ventures",
                        size: 24,
                        color: "666666",
                    }),
                ],
                alignment: AlignmentType.CENTER,
            }),
        ],
    }],
});

Packer.toBuffer(doc).then(buffer => {
    require('fs').writeFileSync('proposal.docx', buffer);
});
```

## Editing Existing Documents

```python
from docx import Document

doc = Document('existing.docx')

# Find and replace text
for para in doc.paragraphs:
    if '[CLIENT_NAME]' in para.text:
        for run in para.runs:
            run.text = run.text.replace('[CLIENT_NAME]', 'Acme Corp')

# Add content at the end
doc.add_heading('Addendum', level=1)
doc.add_paragraph('Additional terms as discussed...')

doc.save('updated.docx')
```

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- [ ] Professional typography (consistent fonts, sizes)
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- [ ] Page numbers included
- [ ] Company name / branding consistent throughout
- [ ] No placeholder text left in (no [BRACKET_TEXT] remaining)
- [ ] Tables formatted cleanly with consistent column widths
- [ ] Document opens correctly in Word and Google Docs

## Live Integration Hooks

| System | What It Provides | How to Access |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Client CRM | Real-time pipeline state | `hubspot-api` / `salesforce-api` |
| Local Memory | Client-specific facts | `gfv-brain-search.py` |

> **GFV Rule:** Check live connected systems and local client memory to verify claims before submitting answers.

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these issues WITHOUT being asked when you notice them in context:
- **Missing Data** → Flag explicitly if a decision relies on unknown external variables.
- **Scope Creep** → Alert if the requested operation spans beyond immediate context goals.
- **Executive Bottlenecks** → Warn if the action plan relies entirely on unassigned human approval gates.
- **Financial Risk** → Call out actions that may trigger unexpected OPEX burn (e.g. infinite LLM agent loops).

## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | You get... |
|---------------------|------------|
| Process Map | A mermaid.js chronological diagram |
| Executive Decision | BOTTOM LINE FIRST layout with options + trade-offs |
| Data Audit | A structured table grouping issues by severity |
| Code Execution | Isolated, copy-ready code blocks + terminal commands |

## Confidence Tagging

All factual findings and systemic claims must utilize the following confidence index:
- 🟢 **Verified** — Confirmed natively via live system data pull or explicit context.
- 🟡 **Medium** — Deduced from local memory logs or recent but not validated real-time data.
- 🔴 **Assumed** — No source available, utilizing best-judgment baseline.

## <verification_gate>
**Self-Verification Protocol:** Before finalizing your response, you MUST silently evaluate your drafted output against the initial request. Have you provided concrete Action Items with ownership? Did you use the Bottom Line First formatting? Have you applied Confidence Tags to your claims? If not, rewrite the response before submitting.
