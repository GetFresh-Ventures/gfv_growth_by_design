# Doc Coauthoring

Write documents that work for readers who weren't in the room.


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "Co-write a strategy document with me"
- "I have a rough draft — help me structure it"
- "Build an outline, then we'll write together"


## When to Activate

- Writing strategy documents, board memos, decision docs
- Creating proposals or engagement letters
- Any high-stakes document that needs to survive without the author present
- When the CEO says "help me write" or "let's put this together"

## The Three-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Context Gathering

**Goal:** Close the gap between what the CEO knows and what the agent knows.

Ask these meta-questions:
1. What type of document is this? (strategy doc, decision doc, proposal, memo)
2. Who's the primary audience?
3. What's the desired impact when someone reads this?
4. Is there a template or specific format to follow?
5. Any constraints or context to know?

Then encourage the CEO to **dump all context** they have:
- Background on the project/problem
- Related discussions or prior documents
- Why alternative solutions aren't being used
- Organizational context (team dynamics, politics, past failures)

**Accept messy input.** The CEO can answer in shorthand, bullet points, or stream of consciousness. Structure comes later.

### Stage 2: Section-by-Section Refinement

Build each section iteratively:

1. **Propose structure** — Suggest document outline based on context gathered
2. **Draft section by section** — Don't try to write everything at once
3. **Brainstorm at each section** — Offer alternatives, highlight gaps, suggest stronger framing
4. **Edit iteratively** — Refine based on CEO feedback

**Key principles:**
- One idea per paragraph
- Lead with the conclusion, then support it
- Cut everything that doesn't serve the reader
- Active voice, concrete language, no weasel words
- If a section needs data you don't have, flag it explicitly

### Stage 3: Reader Testing (The Secret Weapon)

**Before delivering the final document, test it with a fresh perspective:**

1. Take the finished document
2. Read it as if you had ZERO context about the project
3. Identify:
   - Sentences that only make sense if you were in the room
   - Acronyms or references that aren't explained
   - Logic jumps that skip important reasoning
   - Claims without evidence
   - Sections where a reader would think "so what?"

4. Report findings and fix them before the CEO sends it out

**This catches the #1 failure mode of executive documents:** the author assumes the reader has context they don't.

## Document Types and Templates

### Strategy Document
```
1. Executive Summary (the answer first)
2. Context / Background
3. The Problem (why now)
4. Options Considered
5. Recommended Approach
6. Implementation Plan
7. Risks and Mitigations
8. Decision Needed
```

### Decision Document
```
1. Decision Needed (one sentence)
2. Background (brief context)
3. Options (2-4 realistic options)
4. Recommendation (with reasoning)
5. Risks of recommended option
6. Risks of NOT acting
7. Next steps if approved
```

### Board Memo
```
1. Date, To, From, Re
2. Summary (3 sentences max)
3. Background
4. Key Issues
5. Recommendation
6. Required Board Action
7. Appendix
```

## Hard Bans on Bad Writing

Delete and rewrite:
- "It goes without saying" (then don't say it)
- "At the end of the day"
- "Synergy," "leverage," "paradigm shift"
- Passive voice hiding accountability ("mistakes were made")
- Paragraphs longer than 5 sentences
- Bullet lists with more than 7 items without grouping

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- [ ] Reader Test passed (no context-dependent blind spots)
- [ ] Every section has a clear purpose
- [ ] The document answers "so what?" in the first paragraph
- [ ] Claims are backed by evidence or flagged as assumptions
- [ ] A reader with no context can understand and act on it

## Live Integration Hooks

| System | What It Provides | How to Access |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Client CRM | Real-time pipeline state | `hubspot-api` / `salesforce-api` |
| Local Memory | Client-specific facts | `gfv-brain-search.py` |

> **GFV Rule:** Check live connected systems and local client memory to verify claims before submitting answers.

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these issues WITHOUT being asked when you notice them in context:
- **Missing Data** → Flag explicitly if a decision relies on unknown external variables.
- **Scope Creep** → Alert if the requested operation spans beyond immediate context goals.
- **Executive Bottlenecks** → Warn if the action plan relies entirely on unassigned human approval gates.
- **Financial Risk** → Call out actions that may trigger unexpected OPEX burn (e.g. infinite LLM agent loops).

## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | You get... |
|---------------------|------------|
| Process Map | A mermaid.js chronological diagram |
| Executive Decision | BOTTOM LINE FIRST layout with options + trade-offs |
| Data Audit | A structured table grouping issues by severity |
| Code Execution | Isolated, copy-ready code blocks + terminal commands |

## Confidence Tagging

All factual findings and systemic claims must utilize the following confidence index:
- 🟢 **Verified** — Confirmed natively via live system data pull or explicit context.
- 🟡 **Medium** — Deduced from local memory logs or recent but not validated real-time data.
- 🔴 **Assumed** — No source available, utilizing best-judgment baseline.

## <verification_gate>
**Self-Verification Protocol:** Before finalizing your response, you MUST silently evaluate your drafted output against the initial request. Have you provided concrete Action Items with ownership? Did you use the Bottom Line First formatting? Have you applied Confidence Tags to your claims? If not, rewrite the response before submitting.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Voice doesn't match mine | Load your voice model first — run `/voice-model` before co-authoring |
| Structure feels wrong | Start with the outline stage — get agreement on structure before writing |
