# Scenario War Room

Model cascading what-if scenarios across all business functions. Not single-assumption stress tests — compound adversity that shows how one problem creates the next.

**Trigger phrases:** "what if", "worst case", "what happens if we lose", "pre-mortem", "stress test", "scenario plan", "risk model"

---


## Quick Start
Just say any of these:
- "What happens if we lose our biggest client?"
- "Model the impact of a 20% price increase"
- "Run a worst-case scenario for our Q3 forecast"


## What This Is NOT
- **Not** a single-assumption stress test (that's executive-mentor stress-test)
- **Not** financial modeling only — every function gets modeled
- **Not** worst-case-only — models 3 severity levels
- **Not** paralysis by analysis — outputs concrete hedges and triggers

---

## Step 1: Define Scenario Variables (max 3)

State each variable with:
- **What changes** — specific, quantified if possible
- **Probability** — your best estimate
- **Timeline** — when it hits

```
Variable A: Top customer (28% of revenue) gives 60-day termination notice
  Probability: 15% | Timeline: Within 90 days

Variable B: Key hire (lead tech or sales lead) resigns
  Probability: 20% | Timeline: Unknown

Variable C: Market downturn reduces inbound leads by 30%
  Probability: 25% | Timeline: Q3-Q4
```

**Max 3 variables per scenario.** More than 3 is noise — you can't meaningfully prepare for 5-variable collapse.

---

## Step 2: Domain Impact Mapping

For each variable, each relevant role models impact:

| Domain | Owner | Models |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Cash & runway | CFO Advisor | Burn impact, runway change, bridge options |
| Revenue | CRO Advisor | Revenue gap, churn cascade risk, pipeline |
| Operations | COO Advisor | Capacity, process risk, OKR impact |
| Marketing | CMO Advisor | CAC impact, competitive exposure |
| People | Founder Coach | Attrition cascade, hiring implications |
| Strategy | CEO Advisor | Direction impact, investor narrative |

---

## Step 3: Cascade Effect Mapping

**This is the core.** Show how Variable A triggers consequences that trigger Variable B's effects:

```
TRIGGER: Customer churn ($280K annual revenue)
  ↓
CFO: Revenue drops, cash runway shrinks from 14 → 9 months
  ↓
COO: Hiring freeze; 2 planned hires deferred
  ↓
CRO: Pipeline coverage drops; existing team stretched → close rates decline
  ↓
CMO: CAC increases as we fight harder for same leads
  ↓
CFO: [DEATH SPIRAL WARNING — if not interrupted here]
  ↓
INTERRUPT: Cut 2 low-ROI channels, redirect $50K/mo to highest-converting source
```

Name the cascade explicitly. **Show where it can be interrupted.**

---

## Step 4: Severity Matrix

Model three scenarios:

| Scenario | Definition | Recovery |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Base** | One variable hits; others don't | Manageable with plan |
| **Stress** | Two variables hit simultaneously | Requires significant response |
| **Severe** | All variables hit; full cascade | Existential; requires board/investor intervention |

For each severity level:
- Runway impact (months)
- Revenue impact ($)
- Headcount impact
- Timeline to unacceptable state (trigger point)

---

## Step 5: Early Warning Signals

Define the measurable signal that tells you a scenario is unfolding **before** it's confirmed:

```
Trigger for Customer Churn Risk:
  - Sponsor goes dark for >3 weeks
  - Usage/engagement drops >25% MoM
  - No renewal conversation initiated 60 days before contract end
  - Customer mentions evaluating alternatives

Trigger for Key Person Departure:
  - Multiple referral interview requests from team members
  - Above-market counter-offer required in last 3 months
  - Glassdoor activity or LinkedIn "open to work" signals
  - Team member misses 2+ deadlines unusually

Trigger for Market Downturn:
  - Inbound lead volume drops >15% MoM for 2 consecutive months
  - Win rates decline >10% from trailing 6-month average
  - Competitor raises at lower valuation (market signal)
  - CAC increases >20% with no channel changes
```

---

## Step 6: Hedging Strategies

Actions to take **now** (before the scenario materializes) that reduce impact if it does.

| Hedge | Cost | Impact | Owner | Deadline |
|-------|------|--------|-------|----------|
| Diversify revenue concentration to <20% per customer | Sales effort | Reduces single-customer risk | CRO | 2 quarters |
| Retention bonus for 2-3 key people | $30-90K | Locks team through critical period | CEO | 30 days |
| Establish credit line or bridge option | $5K/year | Buys 3 months if revenue drops | CFO | 60 days |
| Document all key-person knowledge | Time | Reduces bus-factor risk | COO | 30 days |
| Pre-negotiate contract extensions with top 3 customers | Relationship | Reduces churn surprise risk | CRO | 45 days |

## Output Format

Every war room session produces:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 SCENARIO: [Name]
Variables: [A, B, C]
Most likely path: [which combination plays out, with probability]

SEVERITY LEVELS
Base (A only): [runway/revenue impact] — recovery: [X actions]
Stress (A+B): [runway/revenue impact] — recovery: [X actions]
Severe (A+B+C): [runway/revenue impact] — existential risk: [yes/no]

CASCADE MAP
[A → domain impact → B trigger → domain impact → interrupt point → end state]

EARLY WARNING SIGNALS
- [Signal 1 → which scenario it indicates]
- [Signal 2 → which scenario it indicates]
- [Signal 3 → which scenario it indicates]

HEDGES (take these actions now)
1. [Action] — cost: $X — impact: [what it buys] — owner: [role] — deadline: [date]
2. [Action] — cost: $X — impact: [what it buys] — owner: [role] — deadline: [date]
3. [Action] — cost: $X — impact: [what it buys] — owner: [role] — deadline: [date]

RECOMMENDED DECISION
[One paragraph. What to do, in what order, and why.]

## Common Scenarios by Stage

**Pre-seed / Seed:**
- Co-founder leaves + product misses market
- Cash runs out + bridge terms unfavorable
- Key customer churns + can't replace revenue fast enough

**Series A:**
- Miss revenue target + fundraise delayed
- Key customer churns + competitor raises
- Lead engineer quits + roadmap slips

**Series B+:**
- Market contraction + burn multiple spikes
- Lead investor wants pivot + team resists
- Regulatory change + compliance costs spike

**Home Services (Portfolio Co A, Portfolio Co C):**
- Top tech quits + peak season starts
- Google Ads cost spikes + lead volume drops
- Major equipment failure + customer complaints surge
- Field Service Platform data loss + billing disruption

## Rules for Good War Room Sessions

1. **Max 3 variables.** More is noise.
2. **Quantify or estimate.** "Revenue drops" is useless. "$280K at risk over 60 days" is useful.
3. **Don't stop at first-order effects.** The damage is in the cascade, not the initial hit.
4. **Model recovery, not just impact.** Every scenario needs a "what we do" path.
5. **Separate base from sensitivity.** Don't conflate "what probably happens" with "what could happen."
6. **3-4 scenarios per planning cycle.** More creates analysis paralysis.

## Integration with C-Suite Roles

| Scenario Type | Primary Roles | Cascade To |
|--------------|---------------|------------|
| Revenue miss | CRO, CFO | CMO (pipeline), COO (cuts) |
| Key person departure | Founder Coach, COO | CRO (if sales), CFO (if finance) |
| Cash crisis | CFO, CEO | COO (runway extension), CRO (accelerate revenue) |
| Market shift | CEO, CMO | CRO (repositioning), COO (new segments) |
| Competitor move | CMO, CRO | CEO (strategy response) |
| Operational failure | COO, CFO | CEO (comms), CRO (customer impact) |

---

## Proactive Triggers

- **CEO mentions "worried about" or "what if"** → offer war room session
- **Runway < 9 months detected** → auto-trigger cash crisis scenario
- **Customer concentration > 30%** → flag and offer churn cascade modeling
- **Key person risk detected** (from context or conversation) → offer departure scenario
- **Market signal detected** (competitor raise, pricing change) → offer competitive scenario

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too many variables to model | Fix 80% of variables, vary only the 2-3 that matter most |
| Scenarios feel unrealistic | Ground them in historical data — 'what happened last time X occurred?' |

## Live Integration Hooks

| System | What It Provides | How to Access |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Client CRM | Real-time pipeline state | `hubspot-api` / `salesforce-api` |
| Local Memory | Client-specific facts | `gfv-brain-search.py` |

> **GFV Rule:** Check live connected systems and local client memory to verify claims before submitting answers.

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these issues WITHOUT being asked when you notice them in context:
- **Missing Data** → Flag explicitly if a decision relies on unknown external variables.
- **Scope Creep** → Alert if the requested operation spans beyond immediate context goals.
- **Executive Bottlenecks** → Warn if the action plan relies entirely on unassigned human approval gates.
- **Financial Risk** → Call out actions that may trigger unexpected OPEX burn (e.g. infinite LLM agent loops).

## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | You get... |
|---------------------|------------|
| Process Map | A mermaid.js chronological diagram |
| Executive Decision | BOTTOM LINE FIRST layout with options + trade-offs |
| Data Audit | A structured table grouping issues by severity |
| Code Execution | Isolated, copy-ready code blocks + terminal commands |

## Confidence Tagging

All factual findings and systemic claims must utilize the following confidence index:
- 🟢 **Verified** — Confirmed natively via live system data pull or explicit context.
- 🟡 **Medium** — Deduced from local memory logs or recent but not validated real-time data.
- 🔴 **Assumed** — No source available, utilizing best-judgment baseline.

## <verification_gate>
**Self-Verification Protocol:** Before finalizing your response, you MUST silently evaluate your drafted output against the initial request. Have you provided concrete Action Items with ownership? Did you use the Bottom Line First formatting? Have you applied Confidence Tags to your claims? If not, rewrite the response before submitting.
