### GFV Infrastructure Integration

**Credentials** — Never use `.env` files. All secrets live in macOS Keychain:
```bash
security find-generic-password -s "<service>" -a "<account>" -w
```
Check `~/Documents/Code/gfv-brain/scripts/pil_config.py` for service mappings.

**Data Sources** — Before querying external APIs, check PIL first:
- `search_pil` / `smart_search` / `vector_search` MCP tools (491K+ embeddings, 81K entities)
- Supabase tables: `entity_embeddings`, `ont_entities`, `ont_facts`
- Local SQLite: WhatsApp (59K msgs), Slack (2.5K msgs), `gfv_memory.db`

**Output** — Save results to `~/Documents/Code/gfv-brain/` or PIL via Supabase. Never send external messages (email, Slack, WhatsApp) without the Executive's explicit "send it" approval.

# SEO-GEO Claude Skills

Comprehensive SEO+GEO framework with modules for:
- **build/** — page construction and deployment
- **commands/** — CLI automation
- **connectors/** — API integrations (GSC, GA4, etc.)
- **cross-cutting/** — shared patterns (auth, logging, caching)
- **monitor/** — rank tracking, indexation monitoring
- **optimize/** — on-page, technical, content optimization
- **research/** — keyword research, competitor analysis

See AGENTS.md for full agent configuration.



## When to Trigger
- When requested by the Executive.
- When the task aligns with the core competency of this skill.

## When to Skip
- When the data or answers already exist in the PIL memory bus.
- When the task requires physical intervention or manual approval before drafting.

## GFV Integration
**Credentials** — Never use `.env` files. All secrets live in macOS Keychain:
`security find-generic-password -s "<service>" -a "<account>" -w`
**Data Sources** — Before querying external APIs, check PIL first (`search_pil`, `gfv_memory.db`).
**Output** — Save results to `~/Documents/Code/gfv-brain/`. Never send external messages without the Executive`s explicit "send it" approval.

## Anti-Patterns
- **Summarizing instead of resolving**: Do not just summarize what needs to be done. Do the work.
- **Bypassing the Gate**: Do not execute risky actions without human-in-the-loop validation.

STOP AND VERIFY BEFORE DECLARING THIS TASK COMPLETE.

1. Did you verify that the execution meets all documented requirements safely?
2. Ensure you have not bypassed any "requires_human_approval" constraints.
